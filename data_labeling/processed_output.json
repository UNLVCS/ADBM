    "Abstract": [
      "Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of dementia, which is a gradual condition that begins with mild memory loss and progresses to difficulties communicating and responding to the environment.",
      "Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data, leading to an increased interest in using deep learning for the early diagnosis and automated classification of Alzheimer’s disease.",
      "This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to determine the severity level of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images, where the dataset consists of four levels of severity.",
      "A hybrid of 12 feature extraction methods is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease severity, and six traditional machine learning methods are applied, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, linear discrimination analysis, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble learning methods.",
      "During training, optimization is performed to obtain the best solution for each classifier.",
      "Additionally, a CNN model is trained using a machine learning system algorithm to identify specific patterns.",
      "The accuracy of the Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Linear discrimination classifier, Decision tree, Ensembled learning, and presented CNN architecture are 67.5%, 72.3%, 74.5%, 65.6%, 62.4%, 73.8% and, 95.3%, respectively.",
      "Based on the results, the presented CNN approach outperforms other traditional machine learning methods to find Alzheimer severity."

    "Intro": [
      "Dogan et al. developed a model of primate brain patterns based on EEG signals for the detection of AD.",
      "Using a directed graph to extract features from the primate brain’s connectome, this method demonstrated high accuracy in identifying AD patients from healthy controls.",
      "In order to enhance the accuracy of AD detection, the model is able to generate a set of features from EEG signals.",
      "Using brain images, Kaplan et al. developed a feed-forward Local Phase Quantization Network (LPQNet) for AD detection.",
      "Based on feature generation and selection through multilevel processing, their model demonstrated remarkable classification accuracy across several datasets.",
      "LPQNet stands out for its combination of high accuracy and low computational complexity, which makes it a valuable tool for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease.",
      "Kaplan et al. developed the ExHiF model for the detection of AD using CT and MR images.",
      "They combined exemplar histogram-based features with neighborhood component analysis to achieve 100% classification accuracy.",

    "Method": [
      "The confusion matrix is a specific tool that accurately measures categorization performance.",
      "Learning a few definitions are required to understand the confusion matrix.",
      "But before we get into the theories, let’s look at a fundamental confusion matrix for binary or binomial classification with two classes (say, Y or N).",
      "The potential of a classifier to select all of the examples that must be chosen is referred to as sensitivity.",
      "A perfect classifier will determine all true Ys and exclude any true Ys.",
      "There will be no false negatives to express it in a different way.",
      "In the absence of a classifier, true Ys will be missed, resulting in false negatives.",
      "A classifier is defined as being accurate if it is able to select all instances that need to be picked and to reject all instances that need to be denied.",
      "Fig 2 illustrates the workflow and conceptual diagram in our proposed approach."

    "Results": [
      "To compare the presented CNN method with other machine learning approaches, the AUC values and accuracy of the methods are presented in Table 3.",
      "Based on the results, the accuracy and the AUC value for the presented CNN methods are higher than other machine learning classifiers.",
      "Moreover, the KNN method with 74.5% accuracy and 92% AUC is the second classification priority.",
      "Furthermore, the ensembled learning of Bag, Adaboost, and RUSBoost methods raises the accuracy to 73.8% and 93% AUC.",
      "To conclude.",
      "It can be seen that the presented CNN method has higher accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer’s severity.",
      "Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s patients from normal people is simpler than finding the severity of the disease.",
      "This is because of the close similarity between each class image.",
      "Therefore, the traditional machine learning methods with many feature extraction methods could not reach higher accuracy.",
      "However, the presented CNN solved this problem with 95.3% and 100% testing and training accuracy."

    "Conclusion": [
      "The training procedure achieved 100% accuracy for the categorization of input images based on the findings of the proposed CNN technique.",
      "Nevertheless, out of 300 mild images in the test samples, 288 (96.0%) were properly diagnosed.",
      "As a result, CNN’s sensitivity for detecting mild AD is 96%.",
      "The proposed CNN technique correctly diagnosed mild AD with 100 sensitivity.",
      "Furthermore, normal images are identified in 95.3% of cases.",
      "Consequently, the network’s precision for mild, moderate, normal, and very mild class diagnosis is 93.2%, 100%, 92.6%, and 95.7%, respectively.",
      "The accuracy of our provided CNN architecture was 95.3%.",
      "According to the findings, the accuracy and AUC value for the provided CNN techniques were greater than other ML classifiers.",
      "Furthermore, the KNN technique was ranked second in classification accuracy, with 74.5% accuracy and 92% AUC.",
      "Besides, combining the Bag, Adaboost, and RUSBoost algorithms improved accuracy to 73.8% and 93% AUC, respectively.",
      "To sum it up, the proposed CNN technique was more accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer’s severity."

      "A Review of Commercial and Non-Commercial Wearables Devices for Monitoring Motor Impairments Caused by Neurodegenerative Diseases"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are among the 10 causes of death worldwide.",
      "The effects of NDDs, including irreversible motor impairments, have an impact not only on patients themselves but also on their families and social environments.",
      "One strategy to mitigate the pain of NDDs is to early identify and remotely monitor related motor impairments using wearable devices.",
      "Technological progress has contributed to reducing the hardware complexity of mobile devices while simultaneously improving their efficiency in terms of data collection and processing and energy consumption.",
      "However, perhaps the greatest challenges of current mobile devices are to successfully manage the security and privacy of patient medical data and maintain reasonable costs with respect to the traditional patient consultation scheme.",
      "In this work, we conclude: (1) Falls are most monitored for Parkinson’s disease, while tremors predominate in epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease.",
      "These findings will provide guidance for wearable device manufacturers to strengthen areas of opportunity that need to be addressed, and (2) Of the total universe of commercial wearables devices that are available on the market, only a few have FDA approval, which means that there is a large number of devices that do not safeguard the integrity of the users who use them."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "The four underlying differences of our research, if compared to the literature reviews previously mentioned, can be summarized as follows: First, our review focuses on currently available commercial and non-commercial wearable devices for monitoring NDD-related motor impairments.",
      "Second, we classify these devices according to their characteristics.",
      "Third, we identify both NDD-related motor impairments and the sensors used for monitoring these impairments.",
      "Finally, we discuss the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) status of each of the reviewed wearable technologies.",
      "The focus of this paper is NDD-related motor impairments.",
      "In this sense, our four main objectives are (1) to identify currently available commercial and non-commercial wearables for monitoring NDD-related motor impairments, (2) to list the characteristics of such devices, (3) to rate the top most used devices for monitoring motor impairment in patients with NDDs, and (4) to determine the FDA status of such devices."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "We extracted two types of data in each of the selected studies: (1) bibliographic; for example, title, authors, objectives, and repository and (2) content, with which the research questions raised in this review were answered.",
      "The following section presents the results obtained from the studies considered."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "This review provides valuable information on wearable devices for monitoring motor impairments suffered by patients with NDDs.",
      "First, our findings revealed that commercial wearable technologies generally focus on measuring falls, tremors, and seizures via smartwatches.",
      "As for non-commercial wearables, bracelets and wristbands are the most popular and usually rely on an accelerometer for monitoring.",
      "Both commercial and non-commercial wearable devices are significantly more used on the patient’s wrist because wrist-worn devices offer a significantly good comfort-accuracy ratio.",
      "The ideal wearable device is one that makes a precise measurement of the monitoring performed and that, in turn, is transparent to the user and/or patient.",
      "That is, it is a wearable device that does not interfere with the patient’s day-to-day activities.",
      "In this sense, tattoos, rings, glasses, and clothing (among others) have emerged as wearable trends that are almost completely imperceptible to the patient.",
      "Moreover, thanks to the implementation of AI in the development of these devices, technology based on video monitoring promises to be encouraging in optimizing the monitoring of NDD-related motor impairments since it will not be necessary to wear any device to monitor our health."

      "The Mixed Role of Sleep and Time of Day in Working Memory Performance of Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "The importance of night sleep for maintaining good physical and cognitive health is well documented as well as its negative changes during aging.",
      "Since Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients bear additional disturbances in their sleep, this study aimed at examining whether there are potential mixed effects of sleep and afternoon time of day (ToD) on the storage, processing, and updating components of working memory (WM) capacity in older adults with MCI.",
      "In particular, the study compared patients’ performance in the three working memory components, in two-time conditions: “early in the morning and after night sleep”, and “in the afternoon and after many hours since night sleep”.",
      "The Working Memory Capacity & Updating Task from the R4Alz battery was administered twice to 50 older adults diagnosed with MCI.",
      "The repeated measures analysis showed statistically significant higher performance in the morning condition for the working memory updating component (p < 0.001).",
      "Based on the findings, it seems that the afternoon ToD condition negatively affects tasks with high cognitive demands such as the WM updating task in MCI patients.",
      "These findings could determine the optimal timing for cognitive rehabilitation programs for MCI patients and the necessary sleep duration when they are engaged in cognitively demanding daily activities."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "This study aimed to examine whether the combination of sleep in MCI and afternoon ToD condition (that is, a condition with a long distance from nighttime sleep, without any nap in between) impacts working memory capacity as storage, processing, and updating in older adults with MCI.",
      "The hypothesis of the study was formulated as follows.",
      "Hypothesis 1: MCI patients would exhibit higher working memory storage, processing, and updating performance in the morning and immediately after night sleep, than in the afternoon, after many hours of being awake."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "For data analysis, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 23.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used.",
      "Repeated measures analyses of variance were applied to the data.",
      "The within-subjects variable of the ToD condition had two levels: “early in the morning and after night sleep” vs. “in the afternoon and after many hours since night sleep”.",
      "Partial eta-squared (η2) was used for the estimation of the effect size, while statistical significance (p) was defined at the 0.05 level."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "In our analysis, we tested the assumption of sphericity using Mauchly’s test.",
      "The test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was satisfied for all variables (Mauchly’s W = 1, p =< 0.001 for WM storage, W= 1, p =< 0.001 for WM processing, and W = 1, p =< 0.001 for WM updating).",
      "Therefore, no correction was necessary for the degrees of freedom in our analyses."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "Considering all the above, it can be suggested that the mixed sleep and afternoon ToD effects on cognition seem to be revealed in MCI, when the tasks are more cognitively demanding.",
      "At a deeper level, this could imply that the brain areas associated with demanding tasks such as working memory updating, including the frontoparietal network (FPN), basal ganglia, thalamus, and hippocampus, exhibit reduced activity during these conditions in MCI patients.",
      "Given that good sleep quality can improve the connectivity and the activity of the FPN in these patients, it is evident that such conditions can disrupt this brain network.",
      "Keeping in mind that FPN is involved not only in the working memory, but also in goal-oriented attention, inhibition, and adaptation to feedback, we can assume that sleep in MCI and afternoon ToD negatively affect these additional functions or their combination in demanding tasks."

      "The abundance of Aβ in the aging primate brain is well tolerated, and the impact on cognitive functions is usually limited to particular tasks.",
      "In contrast, human brain aging is characterized by the early appearance of HPtau pathology, mainly forming neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads, preceding Aβ deposits by several decades and by its severity progressing from selected nuclei of the brain stem, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus to the limbic system, neocortex, and other brain regions.",
      "Neurofibrillary tangles correlate with cognitive impairment and dementia in advanced cases.",
      "Aβ pathology is linked in humans to altered membrane protein and lipid composition, particularly involving lipid rafts.",
      "Although similar membrane alterations are unknown in non-human primates, membrane senescence is postulated to cause the activated β-amyloidogenic pathway, and Aβ pathology is the prevailing signature of non-human and human primate brain aging."

      "Human cortical lipid rafts are modified by aging in a gender-dependently way, being more pronounced in women than in men.",
      "Main changes involve plasmalogens, polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid), total polar lipids (mainly phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, sulfatides, and cerebrosides), and total neutral lipids (particularly cholesterol and sterol esters).",
      "Lipid alterations increase at early stages of AD and increase with disease progression.",
      "Biophysical alterations in lipid rafts augment β-secretase in lipid rafts and increase BACE/AβPP interactions, thus modulating the convergence of the amyloidogenic pathway toward lipid rafts and pointing to a critical role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the amyloidogenic processing of AβPP.",
      "Unfortunately, similar studies are not available in non-human primates.",
      "Thus, Aβ deposition is probably linked to age-related altered protein and lipid composition of membranes."

      "Digital endpoints in clinical trials of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases: challenges and opportunities"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are associated with progressive cognitive, motor, affective and consequently functional decline considerably affecting Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and quality of life.",
      "Standard assessments, such as questionnaires and interviews, cognitive testing, and mobility assessments, lack sensitivity, especially in early stages of neurodegenerative diseases and in the disease progression, and have therefore a limited utility as outcome measurements in clinical trials.",
      "Major advances in the last decade in digital technologies have opened a window of opportunity to introduce digital endpoints into clinical trials that can reform the assessment and tracking of neurodegenerative symptoms.",
      "The Innovative Health Initiative (IMI)-funded projects RADAR-AD (Remote assessment of disease and relapse—Alzheimer’s disease), IDEA-FAST (Identifying digital endpoints to assess fatigue, sleep and ADL in neurodegenerative disorders and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases) and Mobilise-D (Connecting digital mobility assessment to clinical outcomes for regulatory and clinical endorsement) aim to identify digital endpoints relevant for neurodegenerative diseases that provide reliable, objective, and sensitive evaluation of disability and health-related quality of life.",
      "In this article, we will draw from the findings and experiences of the different IMI projects in discussing (1) the value of remote technologies to assess neurodegenerative diseases; (2) feasibility, acceptability and usability of digital assessments; (3) challenges related to the use of digital tools; (4) public involvement and the implementation of patient advisory boards; (5) regulatory learnings; and (6) the significance of inter-project exchange and data- and algorithm-sharing."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "Some of these barriers became apparent in RADAR-AD.",
      "For example, engaging with RMTs led to some participants feeling discouraged, as they acted as a reminder for their declining cognition.",
      "Cognitive impairment also led to missing data, e.g., participants removed their wearables before going to bed, meaning sleep hygiene could not be tracked.",
      "Study partners are essential when it comes to reducing or overcoming (cognitive) barriers—they help with charging/handling RMTs, provide emotional support, and remind participants to keep wearing/using RMTs.",
      "Overall, study partners are vital in the adherence and usability of digital tools in neurodegenerative diseases (Muurling et al., submitted)1.",
      "In RADAR-AD and IDEA-FAST, participants reported adjustments to daily routines; specifically, acclimating to wearing two wrist-worn wearable devices, using their phone more, and adjusting personal schedules to complete their daily app-based tasks on time.",
      "Ergonomic challenges were reported due to the physical design of watches (i.e., watch straps not fitting well or feeling limited in their movements).",
      "Similar findings have been collated within multiple systematic reviews on digital tool use in older adults.",
      "Participants reported individual preferences for the display of the wearable screen (e.g., matching the clock face of their usual watch) and for device feedback (e.g., cognition and activity tracking), which facilitated integration into daily routines.",
      "Lack of, or inaccurate device feedback, small screens and small fonts also contributed towards the challenges faced by participants.",
      "In the IDEA-FAST pilot study, participants moreover mentioned skin irritations due to adhesive patches, constant worry about the device and insecurities regarding its proper functioning.",
      "Also, participants reported being less willing to wear devices that were very visible, complicated to use, or that had to be manipulated at impractical times, e.g., right before sleeping.",
      "The roadmap towards translating RMT use from research to clinical practice has to continue to evolve, together with patient and stakeholder involvement, as the benefits and challenges are evaluated."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "We argue that sustainability should be plannable and funded beyond the duration of a project, ideally via IMI-funded platforms, to guarantee a lasting impact and allow following projects to profit from the large data volumes produced by RMTs, previous experiences, including cross-learning about device selection and barriers/facilitators of using digital health technology, especially for studies that are targeting similar demographics and conditions."

      "With the vast amount of data generated, utilizing gene regulatory networks to comprehensively study this disease has become essential.",
      "This review delves into some techniques employed in the field of AD, explores the discoveries made using these techniques, and provides insights into the future of the field."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "However, several challenges persist in the successful application of scMulti‐omics to study AD.",
      "First, multimodal data integration is one of the major obstacles in accurate multi‐omics analysis.",
      "The integration of multiple modalities, each with its own technical protocols and throughput levels, is particularly challenging.",
      "Effective integration must address and reconcile these technical differences and batch effects, while preserving the biologically relevant information.",
      "Additionally, certain modalities might be affected by confounding factors across features which adds additional challenges.",
      "Integration strategy can be broadly classified into vertical or diagonal depending on whether the different data modalities are captured from either the same (matched) cells or different (unmatched) cells.",
      "Vertical integration strategies leverage the clear correspondence between molecular profiles within matched multimodal experiments.",
      "These strategies establish certain cells or cell clusters as anchors to link the different data modalities.",
      "Examples of such methods include SCENIC+, scMVAE, MIRA, and so on.",
      "In unmatched datasets, there are no anchors to link either the cells or features in the high‐dimensional space, making diagonal integration more difficult to validate and interpret.",
      "Diagonal integration typically aims to construct a low‐dimensional latent space that captures the correlation between the data modalities, however even if gene expression and chromatin accessibility are correlated there is no guarantee that the latent representation can capture this information, making it a difficult endeavor.",
      "Commonly used diagonal integration methods include GLUE, LIGER, Cobolt, MultiVI, and Seurat V5, to name a few.",
      "Second, current computational analysis methods are limited in their ability to learn the intricate relationship and cross talk between different data modalities.",
      "For instance, computational methods for variant fine‐mapping can potentially benefit from incorporating multi‐omics data; however, existing methods do not leverage multi‐omics information.",
      "This acts as a barrier in the application of sc‐multi‐omics for inferring the underlying biological mechanism, and their response to external stimuli.",
      "Third, as data complexity increases, such as when dealing with multiple modalities and multiple samples, the need for computational efficiency becomes paramount.",
      "Ensuring scalability to effectively manage vast amounts of data becomes imperative in such scenarios.",
      "The rising popularity of large language models (LLMs) has spurred numerous efforts to apply these models in developing computational methods for single‐cell multi‐omics.",
      "An example is scGPT, a pretrained generative model that utilizes a masked language model training strategy.",
      "When fine‐tuned, scGPT has surpassed state‐of‐the‐art methods in various tasks, including cell‐type annotation and data integration, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in genomic applications.",
      "Enformer presents another use of language model, specifically tailored for predicting gene expression from DNA sequences.",
      "The Enformer architecture uniquely combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformers to enhance computational efficiency.",
      "However, the application of these models in genomics is not without its challenges.",
      "The quadratic complexity inherent in transformer models, coupled with their substantial requirements for graphics processing unit resources and extensive training data, presents significant hurdles.",
      "Moreover, a critical limitation of these models lies in their current lack of mechanistic interpretability regarding their predictions, which is a vital aspect for broader application and understanding in genomics.",
      "Despite these challenges, it is important to recognize that the development of computational methods for the analysis and integration of sc‐multi‐omics is still in its infancy and represents an exciting and rapidly evolving avenue, with the potential for significant improvements in the near future."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "Finally, a comprehensive understanding of AD will require the integration of transcriptomics with epigenetics and proteomics at single‐cell resolution.",
      "Single multi‐omics approaches, such as snATAC‐seq, sn‐ChIP‐seq, and innovative technologies like Paired‐Tag, hold promise for creating cell type–resolved maps of chromatin state and interactions.",
      "Optimizing protocols to concurrently preserve RNA quality and chromatin state is a critical hurdle to overcome.",
      "Moreover, spatial proteomics at single‐cell resolution may elucidate how and to what extent AD risk transcripts are translated into proteins and how these proteins interact with pathological processes.",
      "These are the frontiers that future studies should navigate to uncover the molecular intricacies of AD and propel us towards effective interventions."

      "A more extensive and diverse dataset could further enhance the models’ sensitivity to subtle pain expressions in cerebral palsy patients and possibly extend to other complex neurological disorders.",
      "This research marks a significant step toward more empathetic and accurate pain management for vulnerable populations."

    "Intro": [
      "The work is organized as follows.",
      "Section 2 describes the methods used to build the dataset of pain expressions in individuals with CP and the automated pain recognition system.",
      "Section 3 describes the results achieved and the last Section discusses the main findings and concludes the work."

    "Method": [
      "The three-tiered approach to experimentation was devised to sequentially validate network performance on well-established pain recognition datasets.",
      "This stratification allowed for enhanced assessment of model effectiveness on a novel dataset, the size of which precluded fine-tuning strategies."

    "Results": [
      "In an ideal scenario, the models should exhibit similar heatmaps when applied to both the PAIN-DB and CP-PAIN datasets.",
      "However, as depicted in Figure 6, certain models deviate from this ideal alignment.",
      "SilNet, WeiNet, and SongNet prominently emphasize the forehead region when classifying instances as “Not pain” in the CP-PAIN dataset, a pattern not evident in the PAIN-DB dataset.",
      "This disparity underscores the substantial impact of database differences on model predictions.",
      "Similarly, ResNet50 also demonstrates distinct results by focusing on the lower facial region for pain recognition in CP-PAIN, while primarily centering on the central facial area in the case of the PAIN-DB dataset.",
      "In contrast, the remaining models appear to exhibit relatively consistent reliance on the same facial regions, irrespective of the database under consideration.",
      "Another noteworthy observation pertains to the importance of the lower portion of the face, particularly encompassing the mouth and its vicinity, which emerges as a pivotal factor in pain recognition.",
      "Conversely, the absence of pain is predominantly associated with the upper facial region, particularly focusing on the eyes and their surroundings."

      "Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been a global health concern since 2007.",

      "Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear.",

      "RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation.",
      "Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation.",
      "Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration.",
      "These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "While several studies have reported neuroinflammation and microglial activation as consequences of ZIKV infection, the detailed mechanisms underlying brain impairments in recovering patients remain elusive.",
      "This may be attributable to the lack of a suitable animal model representing the recovery state post ZIKV infection.",
      "Evidence suggests that ZIKV can persist latently in mature neural cells, and its association with widespread changes in gene expression in the brain has been demonstrated.",
      "Thus, it is crucial to move beyond acute phase symptoms to develop an understanding of the long-term neurological sequelae of ZIKV infection, including their potential to lead to neurodegenerative disorders.",
      "To this end, we established an in vivo recovery model of ZIKV infection using ZIKV-susceptible A129 mice.",
      "Through comprehensive RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis, we explored gene expression profiles in the brains of recovered mice post ZIKV infection.",
      "Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed the significant upregulation of the biological process categories “neuroinflammatory response” and “microglial cell activation” in ZIKV-infected mice.",
      "Our findings indicate severe inflammatory pathology, neuroinflammation-induced neuronal cell death, and alterations in neurite morphology in mice recovered from ZIKV infection.",
      "Furthermore, increased levels of phospho-Tau (p-Tau) were observed together with microglial activation in recovered mouse brains.",
      "These findings shed light on the mechanism by which ZIKV affects the brain and underscore the role of this virus-induced microglial activation mechanism in neurodegeneration.",
      "They also have implications for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced abnormalities in the brain and may guide the development of effective therapeutic strategies against ZIKV infection."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "To gain further insights into the effects of ZIKV infection on the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, we examined Tau pathology in ZIKV-recovered mice.",
      "Under normal conditions, Tau protein stabilizes cellular microtubules, but under pathological conditions, the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau disrupts microtubules and damages the cytoskeleton.",
      "This process has been linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.",
      "Several studies have additionally reported that the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau is associated with microglial activation.",
      "Given the significance of p-Tau as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, we conducted further evaluations of Tau protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC).",
      "As shown in Figure 6c, p-Tau staining was significantly increased in the cortex of ZIKV-infected mice compared with uninfected controls and further increased in ZIKV-recovered mice.",

What is the prevalence of reporting patient partner financial compensation? and What are researcher attitudes towards patient partner financial compensation, including perceived benefits, challenges, barriers and enablers to offering financial compensation? To address these research questions we assessed the prevalence of reporting patient partner compensation among published research that engaged patients as well as identified non-financial and financial methods of compensation, the monetary values of financial compensation, and any guidance documents reported as informing the approaches.",

      "The most common themes indicating benefits of financially compensating patient partners were “support patient partner participation” and “facilitate long term engagement across the research project”, since offering financial compensation can enable patient partners to allocate more time to the research project (e.g., attending more team meetings) (Table 5).",
      "One identified theme indicating a challenge to patient partner financial compensation was “financial payments can jeopardize disability or social security payments or impact income tax rates” since financial compensation can impact other income sources.",

    "Method": [
      "Skewness and kurtosis for mean FA values in all white matter tracts were calculated to ensure the data met the assumption of normality.",
      "For all pathways examined, skewness values ranged between −0.98 and 0.06, and kurtosis values ranged between 0.12 and 3.58.",
      "These values fall within the ranges of  for skew values and  for kurtosis recommended by Kim to be used as reference values for the assumption of normality in sample sizes greater than 300.",

    "Results": [
      "Multiple regression analyses were conducted to predict adjusted mean FA values in the selected language and cognitive control related white matter pathways using age, sex, handedness, pubertal status, nonverbal IQ, parental education, household income, English vocabulary, and language use with family and friends as predictors with the 446 bilingual group participants.",
      "Across all models, only sex was a significant predictor for adjusted mean FA values for the bilingual group, in the cingulum bilaterally (left cingulum: , FDR‐corrected ; right cingulum: , FDR‐corrected ; see Table S3 in Supplementary Materials).",
      "Notably, the model predicting FA values in the left cingulum in bilinguals accounted for approximately 5% of the variability in mean FA values, and this was significantly predicted by sex (left cingulum model: F(9,436) = 3.42, , FDR‐corrected ).",
      "Within the bilingual group, lower mean FA values in the cingulum pathways bilaterally were observed in females.",

      "Lower doses of RSV (5 mg/kg/day) still promoted skeletal muscle hypertrophy and reduced exercise-induced muscle necrosis in wild-type mice.",
      "In clinical studies, elderly subjects were supplemented with 500 mg/day resveratrol during exercise, and muscle mitochondrial density and muscle fatigue resistance were higher in elderly subjects compared with placebo-supplemented groups.",

      "To determine the effects of polyphenols on muscle, multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed the effectiveness of polyphenols on muscle pain and muscle recovery after exercise in healthy adults, and the results have shown that consumption of polyphenol-rich foods, juices, and concentrates accelerates the recovery of muscle function and reduces muscle soreness at doses ranging from 150 to 1,500 mg/day.",
      "A meta-analysis suggests that polyphenol supplementation is unlikely to enhance exercise-induced changes in body composition or performance, and that only isoflavones may increase lean body mass in postmenopausal women, and another meta-analysis suggests that short-term polyphenols intake, although attenuating the inflammatory response after exercise, does not affect the anabolic response to protein and exercise in healthy elderly men.",

      "Acceptance of a mobile telepresence robot used to teach adapted physical activity to isolated older adults: extending and testing the technology acceptance model"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "This study aimed to investigate the acceptance of adapted physical activity (APA) by teachers and students before the use of a mobile telepresence robot (MTR), used to remotely supervise isolated older adults’ physical activity.",
      "While previous studies have shown MTR to be fairly well accepted by older adults, nothing is known about its acceptance by APA teachers themselves.",
      "However, if they did not accept it, the MTR would not be used in the end.",
      "This would be a public health issue because isolated older adults would not benefit from supervised APA, yet beneficial to their health.",
      "To this end, 334 participants answered a survey that measured different psychological variables, based on the technology acceptance model (TAM).",
      "Student’s t-tests and structural equation modeling were used for data processing.",
      "Results showed that, before use, there was not any significant difference between teachers’ and students’ acceptance of the MTR.",
      "Then, perceived usefulness for teaching APA, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the MTR were lower than the mean of the scale, while perceived usefulness for older adults was higher than the mean of the scale.",
      "Finally, this study has validated an extended version of the TAM (including the need for competence and MTR self-efficacy), which allowed it to explain 84.3% of the variance of the students’ and APA teachers’ intention to use the MTR for teaching APA to isolated older adults.",
      "Initial obstacles to the use of the MTR seem to exist on the part of APA teachers, prior to their first use, whereas this is not the case for older adults.",
      "APA teachers’ acceptance should therefore be investigated in future studies to examine whether this trend is confirmed after the effective use of the MTR."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "The second objective of the present study was to determine the influence of professional experience by comparing MTR acceptance of APA students and APA teachers.",
      "First, based on the potential benefits of the MTR Ubbo to remotely supervise APA for isolated older adults, we hypothesized that perceived usefulness for teaching APA to isolated older adults, perceived usefulness for keeping or improving isolated older adult’s physical skills, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the MTR would be significantly higher than the mean of the Likert scale for both APA students and APA teachers (H7).",
      "Second, we hypothesized that perceived ease of use would be lower than the mean of the Likert scale both for APA students and APA teachers (H8) because remotely controlling the MTR to supervise older adults’ APA has never been done by the participants previously.",
      "Third, we hypothesized that the scores of all the TAM variables would be higher for APA students than for APA teachers (H9) because APA students are digital natives and more used to include technologies in APA sessions than experienced APA teachers."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "One sample t-tests were then conducted for each variable (perceived usefulness for teaching APA to isolated older adults, perceived usefulness for keeping or improving older adults’ physical skills, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use) to compare the scores with the mean of the Likert scale (i.e., 3), both for APA students and APA teachers.",
      "Finally, t-tests for independent samples were conducted to examine potential differences for each TAM variable between APA students and APA teachers."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "The results of the t-tests for independent samples showed that no significant differences appeared between APA students and APA teachers, regardless of the variable tested (all ps > 0.384).",
      "Consequently, H9 was not validated."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "APA teachers and APA students report a similar MTR acceptance for teaching remotely APA to isolated older adults, before using it for the first time.",
      "Specifically, they seem to not perceive immediately its interest in their job and seem to tend to reject it before a first use.",
      "However, they think that the MTR would be interesting for keeping or improving isolated older adults’ physical skills, which may sound paradoxical and might suggest that acceptance of the robot might evolve after actual use, but this remains to be investigated.",
      "Moreover, this study allowed to understand psychological variables that determine APA teachers’ and APA students’ intention to use, identifying that robot self-efficacy was the most relevant variable to influence acceptance of the MTR.",
      "In conclusion, acceptance of the MTR by APA teachers is a decisive criterion for its future use in teaching APA to isolated older adults, while older adults were willing to use this MTR.",
      "This can contribute to maintaining health of isolated older adults that usually have not access to APA teachers, which is a public health issue.",
      "They might improve their quality of life through maintaining their physical skills as long as possible, the aim being to slow down the decline due to aging."

      "Alzheimer’s disease linked Aβ42 exerts product feedback inhibition on γ-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling"

      "Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer’s disease (AD).",
      "However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined.",
      "Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases.",
      "We hypothesized that the reported increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.",
      "We conducted kinetic analyses of γ-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Aβ, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Aβ on γ-secretases.",
      "We show that human Aβ42 peptides, but neither murine Aβ42 nor human Aβ17–42 (p3), inhibit γ-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin.",
      "Moreover, Aβ42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.",
      "Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Aβ42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the γ-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Aβ toxicity in the context of γ-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling."

    "Intro": [
      "To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether Aβ peptides can exert inhibition on γ-secretase.",
      "Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human Aβ1–42 inhibits γ-secretase-mediated processing of APPC99 and other substrates.",
      "Strikingly, neither murine Aβ1–42 nor human p3 (17–42 amino acids in Aβ) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions.",
      "We also show that human Aβ1–42-mediated inhibition of γ-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75, and pan-cadherins.",
      "To evaluate the impact of the Aβ-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells.",
      "These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for γ-secretase inhibitors, Aβ1–42 potentiates this marker of apoptosis.",
      "Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the Aβ42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised γ-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD."

      "Intact synaptosomes were spun to obtain a pellet which was resuspended in the minimum amount of PBS, allowing us to estimate the volume containing the resuspended synaptosome sample.",
      "This is likely an overestimate of the actual synaptosome volume.",

    "Abstract": [
      "The development of age-associated diseases is related to the accumulation of senescent cells in the body.",
      "These are old non-functional cells with impaired metabolism, which are unable to divide.",
      "Such cells are also resistant to programmed cell death and prone to spontaneous production of some inflammatory factors.",
      "The accumulation of senescent cells is related to the age-associated dysfunction of organs and tissues as well as chronic inflammation that enhances with age.",
      "In the young organism, senescent cells are removed with the innate immunity system.",
      "However, the efficiency of this process decreases with age.",
      "Nowadays, more and more evidences are accumulating to support the involvement of specific immunity and T-lymphocytes in the fight against senescent cells.",
      "It has great physiological importance since the efficient elimination of senescent cells requires a high diversity of antigen-recognizing receptors to cover the entire spectrum of senescent-associated antigens with high precision and specificity.",
      "Developing the approaches of T-cell immunity stimulation to generate or amplify a physiological immune response against senescent cells can provide new perspectives to extend active longevity.",
      "In this mini-review, the authors summarize the current understanding of the role of T-cell immunity in the fight against senescent cells and discuss the prospects of stimulating adaptive immunity for combating the accumulation of senescent cells that occurs with age."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "In the context of central tolerance, the presence of T-lymphocytes that specifically recognize senescence-associated epitopes does not always seem obvious, but the changes associated with cell aging should be taken into account.",
      "For example, the accumulation of mutations leads to changes in the antigenic structure of various proteins.",
      "Disruption of the processes of post-translational modifications of proteins, which is characteristic of senescent cells, also affects the antigenic properties of epitopes presented in MHC molecules.",
      "In addition, genome instability increases with age and cells undergo activation of transposable elements and formation of particles similar to retroviruses, which makes a serious contribution to aging and accompanies the transition of cells to the senescent state.",
      "At the same time, aging is associated with the activation of non-LTR elements (without Long Terminal Repeats) which are evolutionarily younger, while in the thymus there is mainly a presentation of antigens of LTR elements.",
      "In other words, central tolerance practically cannot be formed to antigens of aging-associated mobile elements.",
      "A recent study shows that spontaneous commensal cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in senescent fibroblasts and presentation of glycoprotein-B epitopes of HCMV in MHC-II complexes makes cytotoxic CD4+ lymphocytes eliminate senescent skin fibroblasts in an MHC-II-dependent manner.",
      "This is consistent with the ideas about the activation of genomic mobile elements and reactivation of commensal viruses in senescent cells and the important role of these processes in the elimination of senescent cells by the mechanisms of adaptive immunity.",
      "Taking into account these features, it becomes obvious that the immunopeptidome of senescent cells has a high immunogenic potential, which can help to develop personalized therapeutic approaches to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of aging."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "It is well known that the risk of multiple pathologies increases with age, including autoimmune, cancerous, infectious diseases, and metabolic disorders, while the regenerative potential of various tissues declines.",
      "Despite these conditions having different pathogenesis, they are marked by a growing number of aging and senescent cells accumulating with age.",
      "At a young age, such cells are removed by immune mechanisms, but their elimination efficiency decreases with time.",
      "The aging of the immune system itself and the formation of peripheral tolerance under prolonged and increasing stimulation by senescence-associated antigens may play a central role in such processes.",
      "Restoration of immunoreactivity against senescent cells will slow down the aging processes and maintain homeostasis and the functions of aging tissues.",
      "However, this is a challenging task, and the solution must take into account the safety and selectivity of the approaches, despite many of them being currently under development and showing promising results.",
      "Therefore, the development of safe and accurate methods for the removal of senescent cells, taking into accounts their high heterogeneity and antigenic diversity, is currently an acute task.",
      "The approaches to intensify or generate an immune response against senescent-associated antigens have great potential in this context due to the adaptive immunity has great precision and specificity of action, as well as a high diversity of antigen-recognizing receptors to cover the entire spectrum of senescence-associated antigens."

      "The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, represents an excellent and tractable model organism for dissecting fundamental disease mechanisms, including neurodegeneration.",

      "Recently, several Drosophila head injury models have been developed that recapitulate key findings from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans and other preclinical models, revealing significant insights into the potential molecular and genetic underpinnings of injury responses.",
      "We recently developed a novel Drosophila model (HIFLI: Headfirst Impact FLy Injury) in which mild repetitive head-specific impacts can be delivered to multiple awake and unrestricted adult flies of both sexes.",
      "In this study, we utilized the HIFLI model to deliver a milder version of repetitive head trauma, which eliminates potentially confounding effects from injury-induced death and enables us to interrogate sex and age-at-injury contributions to the emergence of brain deficits throughout the entire lifespan.",
      "Our data show that exposure to this milder form of head trauma elicits minimal acute deficits but causes profound brain-associated behavioral deficits and brain degeneration that only emerge later in life.",
      "These late-life neurodegenerative conditions are further exacerbated by increasing age-at-injury and disproportionately elevated in mated females.",
      "We further identify that sex peptide signaling involved in female reproduction plays a key role in elevated female neurodegeneration after mild head trauma.",
      "Finally, RNA sequencing data suggest that the chronic suppression of innate immune defense networks in mated females may mediate the elevated vulnerability to neurodegeneration after mild head trauma.",
      "Together, our results further establish Drosophila as an excellent model system to investigate lifelong neurodegenerative conditions, highlight that sex and age significantly contribute to trauma recovery and outcome, and support the notion that physical insults to the head, even very mild ones, pose a major threat for brain health."

      "In males, D3Inj induced 1 upregulated and 10 downregulated gene transcripts on D45 compared to the sham group.",
      "In wildtype-mated females, D3Inj elicited eight significant alterations (two upregulated and six downregulated).",

      "We noted the lack of common injury-induced changes between all four conditions, except for one transcript shared between males, wildtype-mated females, and SP0-mated females (Figure 8F).",
      "This suggests that chronic transcriptomic profiles in response to vmHT were also sexually dimorphic and reproductive status dependent.",
      "Importantly, vmHT altered the expression of seven unique genes in wildtype-mated female brains.",
      "Three of these transcripts lie within immune system processes (GO:0002376), but the functions of the other four transcripts were not as clear.",

      "Across the world, the officially reported number of COVID-19 deaths is likely an undercount.",
      "Establishing true mortality is key to improving data transparency and strengthening public health systems to tackle future disease outbreaks.",

      "Of them, around 40% of inhabitants (~ 2 million) reside in urban slums, with an additional floating population of migrants from surrounding rural areas.",
      "Between 1st January 2020 and 31st December 2021, Pune officially reported more than half a million COVID-19 cases and 9093 COVID-19 deaths over two successive waves (Fig. 1, Fig.",

      "This translates to an estimated undercount factor—the ratio of estimated excess deaths to officially reported COVID-19 deaths—of 1.6 [95% CI: 1.1–2.5] for Pune from March 2020 to December 2021.",

      "Like other volume electron microscopy approaches, automated tape-collecting ultramicrotomy (ATUM) enables imaging of serial sections deposited on thick plastic tapes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",
      "ATUM is unique in enabling hierarchical imaging and thus efficient screening for target structures, as needed for correlative light and electron microscopy.",
      "However, SEM of sections on tape can only access the section surface, thereby limiting the axial resolution to the typical size of cellular vesicles with an order of magnitude lower than the acquired xy resolution.",
      "In contrast, serial-section electron tomography (ET), a transmission electron microscopy-based approach, yields isotropic voxels at full EM resolution, but requires deposition of sections on electron-stable thin and fragile films, thus making screening of large section libraries difficult and prone to section loss.",
      "To combine the strength of both approaches, we developed ‘ATUM-Tomo, a hybrid method, where sections are first reversibly attached to plastic tape via a dissolvable coating, and after screening detached and transferred to the ET-compatible thin films.",
      "As a proof-of-principle, we applied correlative ATUM-Tomo to study ultrastructural features of blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around microthrombi in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.",

      "Overall, our new ATUM-Tomo approach will substantially advance ultrastructural analysis of biological phenomena that require cell- and tissue-level contextualization of the finest subcellular textures."

    "Intro": [
      "So far, ATUM could not be combined with ET because the former necessitates attaching sections on a solid support, while the latter as a projection method, needs sections to be deposited on electron-transparent films.",
      "While section deposition is usually irreversible in ATUM, we reasoned that plastic tape coating could enable section removal after SEM and transfer onto ET-compatible films.",
      "Thus, selected semi-thick sections could be re-inspected by ET – a novel multimodal approach, which we call ‘ATUM-Tomo’.",
      "We exemplify the ATUM-Tomo approach by assessing structural determinants of BBB leakiness, a key adaptation of the neurovascular unit that controls substance exchange between blood and central nervous system parenchyma and can be locally disturbed in pathologies, including after ischemia, traumatic brain injury or multiple sclerosis.",
      "We had previously characterized BBB leakage around impact-induced microclots using correlative confocal microscopy and ATUM of fluorescent lipid nanodroplets (LNDs) and gold nanoparticles.",
      "At the BBB, the actual barrier function is determined by distinctive ultrastructural features, mostly within the endothelial layer, including tight junctions, pinocytosis, and vesicular transport.",
      "As these structures lie below the 30 nm z-resolution limit of ATUM, they eluded our previous correlative imaging.",
      "Here, we demonstrate that triple correlation using confocal microscopy, volume SEM in combination with ET provides an integrated view of the cellular environment as well as the ultrastructural features of the compromised BBB.",
      "Our application shows that ATUM-Tomo in combination with CLEM is a powerful multimodal approach, enabling a bridging of scales from the mm to the nm range."

      "Moreover, the injected colloidal gold particles and LNDs were accumulated in the vessel lumen, with the identification of LNDs —compared to SEM images—actually facilitated in the ET by the increased resolution (Figure 3E; Figure 3—videos 1–3).",
      "We observed that the endothelial layer showed local edema and detachment from the basement membrane, while tight junctions were still intact (Figure 3E).",
      "Gold particles were detected in platelet vesicles, vacuoles of endothelial cell swellings, as well as in areas of endothelial detachment from the basement membrane (Figure 3E).",
      "We also recovered and reconstructed tomograms from nine serial semi-thick sections (Figure 4).",
      "Comparing the SEM reconstruction with the one from the corresponding serial ETs (Figure 4A) clearly showed that SEM imaging visualizes only the section surface resulting in a coarse three-dimensional rendering, while ET provided information of the entire section thickness (Figure 4B–D; Figure 4—videos 1–3).",

      "For the HCP Aging sample, higher grip strength (r = 0.59) was linked to longer sleep duration (r = 0.74) and less somatic symptoms (Lacks energy r = −0.52, Feels tired r = −0.39).",

      "In a cohort of older adults, we observed that healthy sleep and fewer depressive symptoms were associated with better MP.",
      "Brain-related associations highlighted more cognitive aspects of MP.",
      "We hope that these findings increase incentive regarding the importance of sleep quality and depressive symptoms to improve motor functioning of ordinary individuals in the society, professional athletes, patients with motor-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, as well as patients with psychiatric conditions including major depressive disorder.",
      "In order to extend these findings and assess the reproducibility of our findings, future large-scale studies using open data sharing and ENIGMA consortium should assess a range of motor behaviours together with a broader range of phenotypic measures, such as personality, environmental and lifestyle factors in younger and older adults, which are critical aspects toward personalised medicine.",

      "Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade prevents the degradation of β-catenin, which translocate into the nucleus to activate the TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor family) transcription factor family, promoting the transcription of genes involved in neuronal plasticity, memory, and learning.",

      "We have primarily focused on the positive effects of well-being, reflecting the considerable body of evidence demonstrating its beneficial impacts—whether hedonic or eudaimonic—on various health outcomes (see).",
      "Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to acknowledge that well-being may, to some extent also have adverse effects on health.",
      "For instance, research has demonstrated that positive emotions such as joy may encourage risk-taking behavior by fostering overconfidence.",

    "Conclusion": [
      "Indeed, we live in an aging society where, for example, the average age of the workforce is expected to increase still further.",
      "Therefore, the numbers of interventions and programs targeting age stereotypes and well-being is increasing.",

      "As puts in: “Well-being is not only a desirable outcome, it also has been found to be an important predictor of all kinds of positive outcomes.” Despite this, well-being is rarely considered as an indicator of the effectiveness of stereotype-based interventions.",
      "Thus, future research should determine the extent to which well-being (and its subcomponents) can be predicted by age stereotypes (and their reduction) when both of these are measured directly.",
      "Moreover, the research discussed in this paper also clearly suggests that the well-being of older adults and initiatives undertaken to improve it would benefit greatly from a reduction in age-related stereotypes, an aim that could perhaps be achieved through future interventions and field programs."

      "This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM).",
      "Mann–Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15).",
      "Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks.",
      "Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults.",
      "These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging.",
      "This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory–motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks."

      "Many participants reported reduced anxiety about memory concerns and an associated increase in self-confidence related to memory ability in everyday situations.",
      "Responses indicated that this reduced level of worry stemmed from an improved understanding about memory, how it works, and how it changes throughout life, in addition to knowing practical memory strategies that can be deployed in real-life situations.",
      "The specific strategies mentioned most often by participants as being useful included using external memory aids, staying calm and not worrying about memory issues when they occur, and actively concentrating when taking in information.",
      "The responses suggested that OPTIMiSE also served to reinforce participants’ existing memory strategies, specifically using external memory aids and keeping important objects in a specific place.",

    "Title": "Towards identification of postharvest fruit quality transcriptomic markers in Malus domestica",
    "Abstract": [
      "Gene expression is highly impacted by the environment and can be reflective of past events that affected developmental processes.",
      "It is therefore expected that gene expression can serve as a signal of a current or future phenotypic traits.",
      "In this paper we identify sets of genes, which we call Prognostic Transcriptomic Biomarkers (PTBs), that can predict firmness in Malus domestica (apple) fruits.",
      "In apples, all individuals of a cultivar are clones, and differences in fruit quality are due to the environment.",
      "The apples transcriptome responds to these differences in environment, which makes PTBs an attractive predictor of future fruit quality.",
      "PTBs have the potential to enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce crop loss, and provide higher and more consistent quality for consumers.",
      "However, several questions must be addressed.",
      "In this paper we answer the question of which of two common modeling approaches, Random Forest or ElasticNet, outperforms the other.",
      "We answer if PTBs with few genes are efficient at predicting traits.",
      "This is important because we need few genes to perform qPCR, and we answer the question if qPCR is a cost-effective assay as input for PTBs modeled using high-throughput RNA-seq.",
      "To do this, we conducted a pilot study using fruit texture in the ‘Gala’ variety of apples across several postharvest storage regiments.",
      "Fruit texture in ‘Gala’ apples is highly controllable by post-harvest treatments and is therefore a good candidate to explore the use of PTBs.",
      "We find that the RandomForest model is more consistent than an ElasticNet model and is predictive of firmness (r2 = 0.78) with as few as 15 genes.",
      "We also show that qPCR is reasonably consistent with RNA-seq in a follow up experiment.",
      "Results are promising for PTBs, yet more work is needed to ensure that PTBs are robust across various environmental conditions and storage treatments."

    "Intro": [
      "To explore which predictive models are most appropriate, we explore two common methods for association analysis, Elastic Net (EN) and Random Forest (RF) feature selection, for the identification of potential PTBs using a large RNA-seq and fruit quality dataset.",
      "We further verify our PTBs using Boruta feature selection and demonstrate that a relatively small set (15 PTBs) could be sufficient for accurate predictions of loss of firmness within our dataset.",
      "Finally, we used qPCR to test the robustness of a subset of potential PTBs in a different lot of ‘Gala’ fruit not used for model development to explore the feasibility for qPCR to be used as a lower-cost assay for models built with RNA-seq."

      "The genes with the top 15 summed feature importance were then used in a new model, with model performance and feature importance being calculated."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "For qPCR, we selected 15 genes out of the top 30 genes from the RF-fm, about half of which were within the top 15 most important genes.",
      "To assess if model performance would drop further if ‘less’ important genes were included, we ran the Random Forest model using the 15 genes selected for qPCR (Random Forest qPCR Genes from Table 1).",
      "The performance for this gene set was 0.897 ± 0.011 SD for the training data and 0.748 ± 0.077 for the testing data, which was like the performance of the top 15 overall gene model (RF-rm, Table 1).",
      "The performance of a single run of the qPCR model is visualized in Fig 8.",
      "This provides another layer of evidence to suggest that the model is not overfitting and that despite variation in years, correlation holds.",
      "Second, because the set of genes used for qPCR had a wider range of importance scores (selected from the top 30 genes from the RF-fm) and these genes still performed well in the RF model, it implies that there may not be a single set of genes that are predictive of the phenotype being investigated.",
      "This is important for future PTB development because it allows for flexibility in terms of gene selection; other pragmatic criteria could be considered, such as signal-to-noise ratios, variability, and ease of testing."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "While our results show that transcriptomics can be used to identify putative predictive biomarkers of traits that are highly impacted by the environment, it should be noted that this study is not exhaustive.",
      "Fruit texture in apples is well understood and controllable using common postharvest practices and the models developed in this study should be regarded as a proof of concept and a promising first step towards identification of PTBs in complex fruit quality traits (i.e. fruit texture) for ‘Gala’ apple.",
      "Importantly, this paper provides answers to questions that will be useful for anyone seeking to develop biomarkers using gene expression.",
      "More research is needed to understand other limitations (i.e., sample size requirements), and how other factors (such as gene expression normalization) affect model robustness.",
      "Because the number of environmental variables experienced by apple fruit throughout the production environment is large, more data will be needed before PTBs for complex fruit quality traits can be used in an applied setting.",
      "Further work in this area may yield information that can be used to expand the postharvest toolkit for managing apple fruit quality, leading to increased supply chain efficiency and less waste.",
      "Moreover, because gene expression is ubiquitous across all living organisms, PTBs show promise as a tool for any species with traits that are highly impacted by the environment."

    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "The present study analyzes two potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).",
      "One is the suppression of the neuronal integrated stress response (ISR).",
      "Another is the targeted degradation of intraneuronal amyloid-beta (iAβ) via the activation of BACE1 (Beta-site Aβ-protein-precursor Cleaving Enzyme) and/or BACE2.",
      "Both approaches are rational.",
      "Both are promising.",
      "Both have substantial intrinsic limitations.",
      "However, when combined in a carefully orchestrated manner into a composite therapy they display a prototypical synergy and constitute the apparently optimal, potentially most effective therapeutic strategy for AD."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Some composite AD therapy scenarios, described above in Section 25 (for conventional AD; see Figure 13, panel A) and Section 33 (for unconventional AD; see Figure 23), entail the long-term activation of BACE1 and/or BACE2 following the withdrawal of inhibitors of the integrated stress response, i.e., under ISR conditions.",
      "In these scenarios, it is assumed that BACE1 and BACE2 continue to be produced under ISR conditions, when translation of the bulk of cellular proteins is suppressed as a result of the phosphorylation of eIF2α.",
      "This may not be the case; the continuous production and presence of BACE1 and BACE2 in human neurons under ISR conditions remain to be ascertained (this can be achieved using the human neuronal cell-based AD model described in).",
      "On the other hand, BACE1 and BACE2 are certainly produced in neurons under regular (i.e., non-ISR) conditions.",
      "Therefore, even if the continuous production and, consequently, the cellular presence of BACE1 and BACE2 were affected by the ISR (both BACE1 and BACE2 are redundant in the production of iAβ, independently of AβPP, and their absence would impede neither the generation of iAβ in the AβPP-independent pathway nor the progression of AD), the transient administration of their activators in the presence of ISR inhibitors (i.e., under non-ISR conditions), as described in Section 25 for conventional AD (see Figure 13, panel B) and Section 34 and Section 35 for unconventional AD (see Figure 24 and Figure 25), would remain fully applicable.",
      "In other words, BACE1 and BACE2 may not be produced in the neurons under ISR conditions.",
      "In such a case, their utilization as iAβ degradation agents would be feasible both for the prevention of conventional AD (when no neuronal ISR has yet been elicited; see Section 18 and Figure 9, panel A) and in the presence of ISR inhibitors (in circumstances when the neuronal ISR has already been elicited; the relevant sections and figures are listed in the section above).",
      "In this scenario, the inhibition of the neuronal ISR has a double duty.",
      "One, it disables the AβPP-independent iAβ generation pathway and, consequently, stops the influx of iAβ that is produced in this pathway.",
      "Two, by enabling the production of BACE1 and BACE2, it makes their utilization as iAβ degradation agents possible.",
      "Therefore, as an example, even if the rate of degradation of iAβ by activated BACE1 and/or BACE2 were to match or exceed that of its generation in the AβPP-independent pathway (as illustrated in Figure 9, panel B), the therapeutic utilization of both activities may still require the suppression of the neuronal ISR in order to enable their production."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "The preceding three sections have been introduced to highlight the potential efficiency of the generation of iAβ in the AβPP-independent pathway and to assist in assessing the potential effectiveness of iAβ degradation therapy in the treatment of AD.",
      "Above, we have established that, with a substantial degree of certainty, iAβ depletion therapy, via the activation of BACE1 and/or BACE2 or otherwise, would be highly effective in the prevention of conventional AD, when the AβPP-independent iAβ generation pathway is inoperative.",
      "The basis for this conclusion is an observation that an only 30% increase in the efficiency of BACE1 cleavage at the β’-site (position Aβ10) is sufficient to prevent both AD and AACD.",
      "Potentially, the efficiency of BACE1 cleavages not only at the position Aβ10 but also at Aβ34 can be activated to a significantly greater extent.",
      "Even more potent in the depletion of iAβ would be the enhancement in the rate of cleavages at positions Aβ19 and Aβ20, the major activity of BACE2.",
      "It should be reemphasized, however, that in the proposed prevention of conventional AD, only AβPP-derived iAβ is being depleted; the AβPP-independent iAβ generation pathway remains inoperative at this stage.",
      "To roughly assess what we are up against in the treatment of symptomatic AD, when the AβPP-independent iAβ production pathway is operational, it is instructive to compare the efficiencies of generation of iAβ in the AβPP proteolytic and AβPP-independent pathways.",
      "For the purposes of comparison, it can be assumed that probably no more than one tenth of Aβ produced by the AβPP proteolysis ends up as iAβ, whereas, in contrast, the entire Aβ output of the AβPP-independent pathway is retained within the neurons as iAβ.",
      "This is already an order of magnitude greater efficiency for the latter.",
      "In the AβPP proteolytic pathway, a 771 amino acid residues-long precursor needs to be synthesized for every Aβ molecule to be produced.",
      "In the AβPP-independent pathway, only a C100 fragment needs to be synthesized for every iAβ to be generated.",
      "Here is roughly another order of magnitude difference in efficiencies.",
      "Moreover, it is exceedingly plausible that the generation of iAβ in the AβPP-independent manner in Alzheimer’s disease is enabled by the asymmetric RNA-dependent amplification of human AβPP mRNA.",
      "This, apparently, appends additional orders of magnitude difference in the efficiency of generation of iAβ by the AβPP proteolysis versus the AβPP-independent pathway.",
      "This is because, as argued above, in its efficiency, the mammalian RNA-dependent mRNA amplification process is equivalent to a massive gene amplification in that amplified mRNA is produced from hundreds or even thousands of conventionally gene-transcribed mRNA templates.",
      "The bottom line is that the rate of the influx of iAβ produced in the AβPP-independent pathway is potentially many orders of magnitude greater than that of iAβ generated by AβPP proteolysis and could be so substantial that, practically, it cannot be matched, not to speak exceeded, by the targeted degradation of iAβ via the activation of BACE1 and/or BACE2.",
      "In other words, BACE1 and/or BACE2 activators could be effective in situations where iAβ is derived only by AβPP proteolysis, but would be inefficient on their own in circumstances involving the production of iAβ in the AβPP-independent pathway."

      "Results: In total, we identified and characterize 2865 tissue-specific ADALs across seven brain regions.",
      "Based on their computationally inferred perturbational profiles using the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signature (LINCS) dataset, these ADALs were then prioritized using our integrative weighted and co-expression network analyses.",
      "Finally, 142 ADALs were prioritized as potential drug targets for our future independent assessment by both registered clinical trial data and AD medical expert knowledge.",

      "Adult neurogenesis is a multistage process by which new neurons are generated and migrate to be integrated into existing neuronal circuits.",
      "In the adult brain, neurogenesis is mainly localized in two specialized niches: the subventricular zone adjacent to the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus.",
      "An increasing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is tightly controlled by environmental conditions with the niches.",
      "In recent studies, exosomes released from different sources of cells were shown to play an active role in regulating neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, thereby participating in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders in patients and in various disease models.",

    "Intro": [
      "Finaly, there are even more cogent reasons why dietary restrictions should be kept to an essential minimum.",
      "Despite the best intentions, and even when sufficient care resources are available, the quality of life of patients suffering from dementia is far from ideal (O'Rourke et al.).",
      "Frightening delusions and hallucinations, unprovoked agitation and verbal or physical violence towards the caregivers are only some of the contributors to the poor quality of life.",
      "This is true in the best nursing home or at home with the most devoted caregiver.",
      "Like non-demented individuals, some of the demented individuals are fond of sweets which may constitute one of the few joys of their life.",
      "When sweets products are in sight it is not unusual that a demented individual would “grab” the sweet, the caregiver would try to prevent it, and the event might develop into an argument with the patient becoming agitated adding to the poor quality of life.",
      "Furthermore, too often, agitation in dementia is treated with antipsychotic drugs, which, among their adverse effects, may worsen the T2D and elevate glucose levels.",
      "However, despite accumulating evidence to the contrary, elderly individuals, particularly in nursing homes, are overtreated for T2D (Deakin and Littley; Sjöblom et al.; Boyle et al.; Sinclair et al.).",
      "This opinion manuscript is in no way a call to ignore diet in the management of T2D in the elderly demented but, to raise the dilemmas associated with it.",
      "It should not be ignored that chronic hyperglycaemia via advanced glycation end products has proinflammatory effects and might damage CNS tissue (Wątroba et al.).",
      "Because the dilemma of how to best manage diabetes in elderly demented surfaces often in daily clinical practice, professional organisations of geriatricians, psych-geriatricians nursing home physicians and nurses and diabetologists should consider to provide guidelines specific for this population."

      "Presubiculum principal cells are preserved from degeneration in knock-in APP/TAU mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "The presubiculum (PRS) is an integral component of the perforant pathway that has recently been recognised as a relatively unscathed region in clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD), despite neighbouring components of the perforant pathway, CA1 and the entorhinal cortex, responsible for formation of episodic memory and storage, showing severe hallmarks of AD including, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles and marked gliosis.",
      "However, the question remains whether this anatomical resilience translates into functional resilience of the PRS neurons.",
      "Using neuroanatomy combined with whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, we investigated whether the unique spatial profile of the PRS was replicable in two knock-in mouse models of AD, APPNL-F/NL-F, and APPNL-F/MAPTHTAU and whether the intrinsic properties and morphological integrity of the PRS principal neurons was maintained compared to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampal CA1 principal cells.",
      "Our data revealed an age-dependent Aβ and tau pathology with neuroinflammation in the LEC and CA1, but a presence of fleece-like Aβ deposits with an absence of tau tangles and cellular markers of gliosis in the PRS of the mouse models at 11–16 and 18–22 months.",
      "These observations were consistent in human post-mortem AD tissue.",
      "This spatial profile also correlated with functional resilience of strong burst firing PRS pyramidal cells that showed unaltered sub- and suprathreshold intrinsic biophysical membrane properties and gross morphology in the AD models that were similar to the properties of pyramidal cells recorded in age-matched wild-type mice (11–14 months).",
      "This was in contrast to the LEC and CA1 principal cells which showed altered subthreshold intrinsic properties such as a higher input resistance, longer membrane time constants and hyperexcitability in response to suprathreshold stimulation that correlated with atrophied dendrites in both AD models.",
      "In conclusion, our data show for the first time that the unique anatomical profile of the PRS constitutes a diffuse AD pathology that is correlated with the preservation of principal pyramidal cell intrinsic biophysical and morphological properties despite alteration of LEC and CA1 pyramidal cells in two distinct genetic models of AD.",
      "Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this resilience could be beneficial in preventing the spread of disease pathology before cognitive deficits are precipitated in AD."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "Besides showing severe atrophy, excitatory cells also show hyperexcitability in terms of their biophysical and synaptic activity even during the early stages of AD, and this activity resembles epileptiform activity.",
      "The abnormal synaptic hyperexcitability is a consistent observation that spans from human studies to animal and iPSC cell models of AD,.",
      "Also, cells exposed to amyloid pathology show reduced dendritic spine density and a surge in intrinsic cellular excitability, suggesting the role of amyloid in inducing hyperexcitability directly or through indirect mechanisms.",
      "The presence of tau tangles is another well-known factor that is thought to contribute to the network alterations during AD, and interestingly, spontaneous epileptiform activity seen in many familial AD mouse models has been shown to be preceded by the presence of soluble endogenous tau, thus implicating tau as a crucial piece in the network impairment puzzle.",
      "Investigating whether the unique anatomical profile of the PRS is consistent with a preservation of the function of neurons in terms of their intrinsic biophysical properties together with their morphological preservation addresses this knowledge gap in the AD research field.",
      "Therefore, the current study aims to combine neuroanatomy and electrophysiology to investigate whether the anatomical and cellular changes associated with AD, occur in the PRS of two unique knock-in mouse models of AD, APPNL-F/NL-F and APPNL-F /MAPTHTAU and whether these changes translate into functional “preservation” of the principal cells compared with the LEC and the CA1 region of the hippocampus - the first brain regions to be significantly affected in early human idiopathic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and in the most common familial forms of the disease.",
      "Exploring the functional preservation of the PRS would provide us with a better understanding of neuroprotective mechanisms in the brain that could be crucial for future therapeutic interventions in AD."

    "Method": [
      "The significance of the neuroimaging outcome, hippocampal-cortical connectivity, was corrected for multiple t tests at a cluster level within the predefined precuneus ROI (3808 voxels) using AFNI software version 23.1.01 (National Institutes of Health).",

    "Abstract": [
      "Our results aid in the understanding of how aging impacts spatial exploration, and encourages future investigations into how pathological aging may affect spatial exploration behavior."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "We hypothesized the following.",
      "First, alterations to spatial exploration behavior will be seen in midlife adults when compared to the young, building on preliminary findings from our previous study showing less exploration behavior in midlife adults (Yu et al.,).",
      "Furthermore, with previous studies reporting less exploration with age across species (e.g., rodents, wasps, fish) (Thiel et al.,; Yu et al.,; Adelöf et al.,), we hypothesize that this pattern may also be seen in humans during midlife, owing to changes seen in the medial temporal lobe structures in this period (Fjell et al.,; Hasan et al.,).",
      "Second, more extensive spatial exploration behavior (i.e., quantity and quality of environment coverage) will be associated with better spatial memory in both the midlife and young adult groups, following similar relationships previously reported in healthy young adults (Gagnon et al.,; Munion et al.,).",
      "Third, we will be able to classify our participants into young or midlife more accurately using their spatial exploration behavior when compared to their spatial memory, reflecting exploration as a relatively more sensitive marker for cognitive aging.",
      "This result would be in line with findings from a previous study showing age-related differences in visual exploration patterns but not in spatial memory (Segen et al.,).",
      "Here, we expect the same pattern to be seen in with regards to physical exploration.",
      "Alternatively, we could also expect that both exploration behavior and spatial memory will be able to classify our participants into young or midlife categories with similar accuracy, hence representing equally sensitive markers for cognitive aging.",
      "This result is possible because, intuitively, it can be argued that age-related alterations to the spatial learning process could directly result in worse spatial memory."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "In the fourth and final step, we explored whether we could classify participants into the young or midlife groups based on their exploration alone and on their wayfinding success alone, using binary logistic regression models.",
      "Here, the PCs we obtained from step three were used as the independent variables in a binary multiple logistic regression model, with group membership (young or midlife) as the dependent variable.",
      "We then ran a separate logistic regression model with wayfinding success as the independent variable and group membership (young or midlife) as the dependent variable.",
      "We conducted follow-up receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computed the Area Under Curve (AUC) values to assess how well both logistic regression models could respectively classify the participants.",
      "Following this, a DeLong's test for paired ROC curves was performed using the “pROC” package in R (Robin et al.,), to assess statistical differences in the AUC values of both models."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "Although the ROC curve for the model with exploration PCs as predictors had a numerically higher classification score than that of wayfinding success alone, a DeLong's test for two correlated ROC curves showed that there were no significant differences between the AUC values of the wayfinding success curve and the PC1 + PC3 ROC curve (p = 0.107)."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "In conclusion, the results of our study provide novel insight into the impact that normal aging may have on spatial exploration behavior and how different aspects of exploration benefit spatial memory in the midlife and young.",
      "We show that differences in spatial exploration behavior occur alongside differences in spatial memory in the midlife compared to young adults, suggesting that both behaviors are similarly sensitive to age effects.",
      "Knowledge generated from our findings can potentially contribute to the development of training interventions that can help midlife adults improve their navigation abilities, as well as provide a strong platform for future studies to investigate potential changes in spatial exploration behavior as representing an early cognitive marker for AD."

      "Despite numerous studies, we still poorly understand how optic flow processing is impacted in healthy older adults.",
      "Here, we estimated motion coherence thresholds in two groups of younger (age: 18–30, n = 42) and older (70–90, n = 42) adult participants for the three components of optic flow (translational, radial and rotational patterns).",
      "Stimuli were dynamic random-dot kinematograms (RDKs) projected on a large screen.",
      "Participants had to report their perceived direction of motion (leftward versus rightward for translational, inward versus outward for radial and clockwise versus anti-clockwise for rotational patterns).",
      "Stimuli had an average speed of 7°/s (additional recordings were performed at 14°/s) and were either presented full-field or in peripheral vision.",
      "Statistical analyses showed that thresholds in older adults were similar to those measured in younger participants for translational patterns, thresholds for radial patterns were significantly increased in our slowest condition and thresholds for rotational patterns were significantly decreased.",
      "Altogether, these findings support the idea that aging does not lead to a general decline in visual perception but rather has specific effects on the processing of each optic flow component."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "To date, the effects of aging on the processing of the three optic flow components are not fully understood.",
      "Here, we estimated motion coherence thresholds and reaction times for these three components in two large groups of younger and older adult participants (84 subjects in total) using a curved screen that covered an important part of the visual field to reproduce optic flow patterns falling on the retina during navigation.",
      "Because it was reported that motion discrimination performances in older adults are specifically reduced in central vision, a secondary objective was to characterize the same processing when only the peripheral vision was stimulated.",
      "Thus, thresholds and reaction times were also estimated among the same participants using a simulated scotoma that covered the central 20° of their visual field (see the \"Methods\" section).",
      "We reproduced all of these measurements at a different speed as this variable was reported to modulate performances in older participants.",
      "Finally, we also looked for gender differences in our data as previous studies found that age effects on motion processing are more pronounced in women (see Hutchinson et al. and Billino & Pilz for reviews).",
      "The experimental protocol was similar to the one of our previous study on optic flow processing in patients with macular degeneration.",
      "We notably used an adaptive Bayesian psychophysical procedure to estimate robust motion coherence thresholds in our participants."

    "Results": [
      "For each optic flow pattern, we examined whether behavioral responses were biased toward one direction (toward leftward or rightward motion for translational patterns, toward contraction or expansion for radial patterns, or toward counterclockwise or clockwise motions for rotational patterns).",

      "Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) studies have several advantages including increased accessibility, potential for larger sample sizes, and reduced participant burden.",
      "However, BYOD studies offer little control over device performance characteristics that could potentially influence results.",
      "In particular, response times measured by each device not only include the participant’s true response time, but also latencies of the device itself.",
      "The present study investigated two prominent sources of device latencies that pose significant risks to data quality: device display output latency and touchscreen input latency.",
      "We comprehensively tested 26 popular smartphones ranging in price from <$100 to $1000+ running either Android or iOS to determine if hardware and operating system differences led to appreciable device latency variability.",
      "To accomplish this, a custom-built device called the Latency and Timing Assessment Robot (LaTARbot) measured device display output and capacitive touchscreen input latencies.",
      "We found considerable variability across smartphones in display and touch latencies which, if unaccounted for, could be misattributed as individual or group differences in response times.",
      "Specifically, total device (sum of display and touch) latencies ranged from 35 to 140 ms.",
      "We offer recommendations to researchers to increase the precision of data collection and analysis in the context of remote BYOD studies."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "Evidence from indicated that cognitive test scores may vary with personal digital device.",
      "However, it is unclear whether these differences were due to cognitive and demographic factors that vary with personal device choice (e.g., tablet users tend to be older than users of other devices) or if these differences were due to variability in the devices themselves.",
      "Because response time data is essential for so many cognitive tasks, it is critical that we understand what is being measured and the extent to which variation in participants’ personal devices may systematically bias results.",
      "If the variability introduced by BYOD models can be appropriately measured and mitigated, it can lead to greater research precision.",
      "Therefore, in the present study, we investigated device latencies (specifically, display and touch) across a series of popular smartphones and operating systems and provide researchers with a set of recommendations regarding digital assessments of cognition.",
      "Specifically, we used a custom-built robot to stimulate touchscreen input and measure display latencies to characterize the performance of 26 popular phones.",
      "Finally, we provide suggestions for researchers looking to optimize their digital cognitive assessment paradigms (see Table 1)."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "To maintain data quality, we excluded response latencies that may have resulted from technical problems.",
      "Specifically, latencies outside +/− 1.5 SDs from the device’s mean latency for that specific condition were removed.",
      "This procedure removed 1.42% of the capacitive action latencies, 1.23% of the capacitive callback latencies, 1.97% of the display action latencies, and 1.97% of the display callback latencies.",
      "Removal of these outliers produced data consistent with the devices’ purported refresh rate (this is discussed further in the results section)."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "Next, we sought to investigate the influence of OS on our latency metrics.",
      "Table 3 displays OS differences in device characteristics and latencies.",
      "As shown, Android and iOS devices differed significantly on all the display latency measures, ps < 0.001, ds > 2.23, and phone cost, p = 0.002, d = 1.58, although OS did not influence capacitive touch latencies.",
      "Indeed, both the cost and display latency differences across OS types were anticipated such that iPhones (which run iOS) were consistently more expensive than Android devices and also have different implementations when it comes to calling user interface draw functions.",
      "Additionally, there was a significant difference in OS type in the (display) callback-minus-display latency difference score, p < 0.001, d = 2.56, which reflects the nature of how different OS types handle recording action and callback latencies and, again, highlights the importance for researchers to use action rather than callback times for touch input and callback rather than display times for display to acquire the most precise response time."

    "Conclusion": [
      "To arrive at the reported 35 ms minimum, the minimum display and minimum touch latencies were summed for each phone and the minimum across all phones was calculated and reported.",
      "To arrive at the reported 140 ms maximum, the maximum display and maximum touch latencies were summed for each phone and the maximum across all phones was calculated and reported.",

    "Abstract": [
      "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia worldwide, but its early detection and diagnosis remain a challenge.",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate mRNA expression.",
      "Recent evidence suggests miRNAs play an important role in the five major hallmarks of AD pathophysiology: amyloidogenesis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death.",
      "Compared to traditional biomarkers of AD, miRNAs display a greater degree of stability in cerebrospinal fluid.",
      "Moreover, aberrant changes in miRNA expression can be measured over time to monitor and guide patient treatment.",
      "Specific miRNA profiles and combinations may also be used to distinguish AD subjects from normal controls and other causes of dementia.",
      "Because of these properties, miRNAs are now being considered as promising and potential biomarkers of AD.",
      "This review comprehensively summarizes the diagnostic potential and regulatory roles miRNAs play in AD."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "The definitive diagnosis of AD is currently only possible by post-mortem microscopic examination of the patient’s brain tissue.",
      "However, several tools are nowadays available for clinicians to use in diagnosing living patients with a greater degree of certainty.",
      "These diagnostic modalities generally fall into one of the following three categories: clinical neuropsychological criteria, radiological brain assessment, and biochemical screening tests.",
      "Although Aβ and Tau proteins are currently the only well-recognized biomarkers for AD diagnosis, recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are a promising alternative.",
      "Alterations in miRNA expression can be readily detected in a patient’s serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",
      "Compared to protein biomarkers, miRNAs form highly stable complexes that allow for their easier and more cost-effective detection.",
      "Additionally, since miRNAs have been demonstrated to directly regulate several pathways in AD, unique miRNA expression patterns can be used to diagnose AD with a high degree of specificity.",
      "It is currently reported that fluctuations in CSF proteins are not always AD-specific and may only reflect a general state of brain degeneration.",
      "Alterations in tau protein levels, for instance, have been observed to occur in acute brain insults such as stroke and trauma.",
      "While miRNA blood analysis is more convenient, the CSF as a medium better reflects changes in brain physiology and can more closely represent expression alterations of circulating miRNAs.",
      "In this review, we comprehensively summarize and present the current literature on the roles and molecular targets of differentially expressed CSF miRNAs in AD.",
      "We also explore the potential of CSF miRNAs as biomarkers for AD compared to more traditional diagnostic modalities."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "According to the criteria set by the international consensus group on molecular and biochemical markers of AD, the ideal biomarker should have a minimum sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 75%.",
      "In this regard, several studies present promising evidence.",
      "A recent meta-analysis of 18 studies that included a total of 826 AD patients and 658 normal controls indicated that the use of miRNA clusters had a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.84.",
      "A similar study showed that combinations of 2-4 CSF miRNAs distinguished AD patients from healthy controls with a specificity of 75–82%.",
      "Even the use of single miRNAs had good diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional AD biomarkers as their pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 and 0.80, respectively.",
      "Exosomal miRNA-384 was able to discriminate AD from Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100%.",
      "Similarly, miR-384 differentiated AD from vascular dementia (VaD) patients with a sensitivity of 99.1% and a specificity of 100%.",
      "The combination of miR-125b/miR-29a, miR-125b/miR-874, and miR-107/miR-335-5p was found to have a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.76 when distinguishing AD from frontotemporal dementia (FTD).",
      "If these results are confirmed by larger replication studies, it is possible that miRNA expression patterns unique to AD can be used in the future to help distinguish AD from other causes of dementia.",
      "MiRNAs may also help predict individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk of developing AD.",
      "In a large cohort study of 458 MCI patients, miR-206 levels successfully predicted the progression of MCI to AD with a sensitivity of 95.3% and a specificity of 77.8%.",
      "Another study showed that miR-146a and miR-181 also predicted MCI conversion to AD although their specificity was not reported."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "The abnormal expression of miRNAs has been proven to contribute to the pathophysiology of several diseases including neurodegenerative disorders.",
      "This paper reviews the different regulatory roles miRNAs play in the CNS as well as the major pathways by which they are involved in AD.",
      "Many of these targets are regulated by more than one miRNA and it is thus likely that future research can reveal a more complex network is at play.",
      "Although CSF collection is an invasive procedure, it represents the optimal source of miRNAs.",
      "The CSF is in direct contact with brain parenchyma and more accurately reflects real-time changes in miRNA expression.",
      "Moreover, the correlation between miRNA profiles of the brain and blood was found to be only moderately significant indicating that not all expression changes seen in blood are AD-specific.",
      "The use of miRNAs as biomarkers remains a novel area of research.",
      "Compared to traditional biomarkers, miRNAs have several properties that make them more favorable for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of AD patients.",
      "Changes in miRNA expression can also be measured over time to guide or monitor the effects of therapeutic intervention.",
      "However, some studies currently provide inconsistent or contradictory findings with regards to miRNA expression in AD.",
      "Although all miRNA targets are confirmed by luciferase reporter experiments, differences in sample collection, analysis, and contamination may influence study outcomes.",
      "Similarly, insufficiently sized patient populations and the lack of normalized cut-off values can impact how results are interpreted.",
      "Further large-scale replication studies are necessary to address these limitations."

    "Abstract": [
      "Using connected sensing devices to remotely monitor health is a promising way to help transition healthcare from a rather reactive to a more precision medicine oriented proactive approach, which could be particularly relevant in the face of rapid population ageing and the challenges it poses to healthcare systems.",
      "Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls.",
      "Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices.",
      "However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide.",
      "Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring.",
      "In this context, we introduce and describe a zero-interaction digital exhaust: a set of 1268 digital measures that cover large parts of a person’s activity, behavior and physiology.",
      "Making this approach more inclusive of older adults, we base this set entirely on contactless, zero-interaction sensing technologies.",
      "Applying the resulting digital exhaust to real-world data, we then demonstrate the possibility to create multiple ageing relevant digital clinical outcome assessments.",
      "Paired with modern machine learning, we find these assessments to be surprisingly powerful and often on-par with mobile approaches.",
      "Lastly, we highlight the possibility to discover novel digital biomarkers based on this large-scale approach."

    "Intro": [
      "Two notable real-world examples of using extensive sets of digital measures are studies by Cook et al. and Chen et al., which demonstrate the feasibility of using a digital exhaust based on wearable and contactless sensors to predict multiple clinical scores (in the former) and MCI (in the latter).",
      "Building on their work, we aim to evaluate the potential of a systems oriented approach towards long-term remote health-monitoring in the demographics of older adults.",
      "To this end, we first introduce an extensive set of 1268 well-documented digital measures that are entirely obtainable with sensing technologies that demonstrate extensive long-term, real-world evidence in older adults.",
      "Thus, all of these measures are based on a small set of zero-interaction, contactless, and cost-effective sensors that, as shown by Baettie et al., scale well to large ageing-related remote-monitoring projects; this also means that these sensors should be compatible with most long-term monitoring projects in community-dwelling older adults.",
      "Using the resulting comprehensive set of digital measures, or digital exhaust, we further demonstrate how powerful ML based ageing-relevant digital COAs for fall risk, frailty, late-life depression, and MCI can be created.",

    "Results": [
      "We used binary logistic regression to classify PCA and healthy individuals.",
      "Our predictor variables consisted of word frequency, word utterance latency, relational words, the total number of content units, and the probability of mentioning “picnic.” As the sixth variable, we included the probability of mentioning “fisherman” because this content unit had the highest correlation with the group designation, likely due to its visuospatial processing demands.",
      "The average accuracy of the model was 98.15% after leave-one-out cross-validation.",

    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "While many studies focus on segmental variation in Parkinsonian speech, little is known about prosodic modulations reflecting the ability to adapt to communicative demands in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD).",
      "This type of prosodic modulation is important for social interaction, and it involves modifications in speech melody (intonational level) and articulation of consonants and vowels (segmental level).",
      "The present study investigates phonetic cues of prosodic modulations with respect to different focus structures in mild dysarthric PwPD as a function of levodopa.",
      "Acoustic and kinematic speech parameters of 25 PwPD were assessed in two motor conditions.",
      "Speech production data from PwPD were collected before (medication-OFF) and after levodopa intake (medication-ON) by means of 3-D electromagnetic articulography.",
      "On the acoustic level, intensity, pitch, and syllable durations were analyzed.",
      "On the kinematic level, movement duration and amplitude were investigated.",
      "Spatio-temporal modulations of speech parameters were examined and compared across three different prosodic focus structures (out-of-focus, broad focus, contrastive focus) to display varying speech demands.",
      "Overall, levodopa had beneficial effects on motor performance, speech loudness, and pitch modulation.",
      "Acoustic syllable durations and kinematic movement durations did not change, revealing no systematic effects of motor status on the temporal domain.",
      "In contrast, there were spatial modulations of the oral articulators: tongue tip movements were smaller and lower lip movements were larger in amplitude under levodopa, reflecting a more agile and efficient articulatory movement under levodopa.",
      "Thus, respiratory-phonatory functions and consonant production improved, while syllable duration and tongue body kinematics did not change.",
      "Interestingly, prominence marking strategies were comparable between the medication conditions under investigation, and in fact, appear to be preserved in mild dysarthric PwPD."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "To summarize, previous studies report inconclusive results to what extent levodopa affects prosodic speech parameters.",
      "The interplay between intonational and articulatory modifications of prosodic prominence marking of natural sentence productions in PD is still unclear.",
      "Thus, this experiment is designed to examine how PwPD modulate prosodic speech parameters under varying speech demands under three focus structures (background, broad focus, and contrastive focus), and whether their prosodic adjustments change due to the medication state (ON and OFF) as well as the corresponding motor condition.",
      "Note, that focus structure is tightly connected to prosodic prominence, revealing a systematic increase of vocal effort from background to broad focus to contrastive focus in many phonetic parameters in neurotypical sentence productions in German as well as pitch accent placements on focused elements.",
      "In our study, we use a levodopa challenge test to investigate medication effects on motor speech in PD.",
      "We examine speech not only on the acoustic level (pitch, intensity, syllable duration) but also on the kinematic level to gain insights into movement patterns (duration, amplitude) of the lower lip, tongue tip and tongue body.",
      "We hypothesize that PwPD can signal prosodic prominence on the acoustic and kinematic level by using the same strategies as reported for healthy controls.",
      "While the effect of levodopa on acoustic parameters remains unclear, faster and larger kinematic movements are expected under medication."

      "However, only 1024 productions went into analysis of which 509 were produced by PwPD in the OFF and 515 in the ON condition, as some productions were excluded due to mispronunciation or sensor tracking errors.",

      "P-values are based on these comparisons and post-hoc analyses (Tukey method) were completed on the full model by using the “emmeans package” if the main effect of the critical predictor or the interaction term between both fixed effects were found significant.",
      "Nine models were run in total (pitch range, intensity, syllable duration, 3 x movement duration, 3 x movement amplitude)."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "No interaction [X2(2) = 2.3611, p > .05] or main effect of medication condition effect [X2(1) = 0.423, p > .05] were found for tongue body movement duration, but an effect of focus category exists [X2(2) = 68.182, p < .001].",
      "Post-hoc comparisons reveal increased tongue body movement durations across accentuation (background vs. broad: mean difference = 14.92 ms, p < .001 | background vs. contrastive: mean difference = 19.67 ms, p < .001, Fig 6).",
      "While no interaction [X2(2) = 0.6176, p > .05] and no main effect of medication condition [X2(1) = 0.4024, p > .05] was found on tongue body amplitude, there was a significant effect of focus category [X2(2) = 16.108, p < .001].",
      "Post-hoc comparisons reveal changes in amplitude across accentuation (background vs. broad: mean difference = 0.511 mm, p = .012 | background vs. contrastive: mean difference = 0.693 mm, p < .001) but not within accentuation (Fig 6)."
    ],
    "Conclusion": [
      "The linguistic function of prosody seems preserved in predominantly mild dysarthric PwPD independent of the medication state.",
      "Therefore, PwPD with mild to moderate dysarthria are able to adapt their speech system to communicative demands to signal prosodic functions relevant for social interactions.",
      "However, levodopa had beneficial effects on phonatory-respiratory speech features, such as loudness and pitch, but did not affect articulatory features of vowel production in this cohort."

      "Adapting Machine Learning Diagnostic Models to New Populations Using a Small Amount of Data: Results from Clinical Neuroscience"
    ],
    "Abstract": [
      "Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing many areas of engineering and science, including healthcare.",
      "However, it is also facing a reproducibility crisis, especially in healthcare.",
      "ML models that are carefully constructed from and evaluated on data from one part of the population may not generalize well on data from a different population group, or acquisition instrument settings and acquisition protocols.",
      "We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging.",
      "We develop a weighted empirical risk minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g., subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc. using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group.",
      "We apply this method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age.",
      "We found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and demographic or clinical characteristics.",
      "In some cases, it is even better than training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity and size of a larger training set.",
      "We also demonstrate the utility of our models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.",
      "Critically, our brain age prediction models lead to new clinical insights regarding correlations with neurophysiological tests.",
      "In summary, we present a relatively simple methodology, along with ample experimental evidence, supporting the good generalization of ML models to new datasets and patient cohorts."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "Our results suggest that one can build machine learning models that are able to effectively ameliorate the heterogeneity of neuroimaging data and also provide accurate predictions on diverse groups of populations, even if some of them are very under-represented (data disadvantaged).",
      "Furthermore, this might indicate that diagnostic models of neurological disorders may be ready to be evaluated in clinical settings—after necessary checks and balances are met."
    ],
    "Results": [
      "Similar to the previous section, we found that improving BAR predictions on target groups using 10% data translates to improved associations with the clinical factors, as compared to the associations computed using BAR prediction models that did not use any target data.",
      "For example, Pearson’s correlations between BAR and DSST/TMT A are −0.453 and 0.128 respectively when a model trained on Asian subjects is evaluated on subjects from the White group.",
      "If we instead improve this model using -weighted ERM and 10% data from the White group, these correlations increase to −0.556 and 0.191 respectively.",
      "Just like the previous sections, models adapted to target groups often lead to greater associations between BAR and cognitive measures compared to those trained only on the target group.",
      "For example, within the Female population, the correlation between BAR and MMSE is −0.161, whereas a BAR prediction model trained using -weighted ERM trained on the source Male group achieves −0.267 on the target Female group.",
      "Note that in this case, the correlation between BAR and MMSE in females is more negative when no data (i.e., 0%) is used to adapt the male-trained model; this is perhaps due to the inadequacy of our hyper-parameter search for the weighing parameter , because having extra should never reduce the performance."
    ],
    "Method": [
      "The weighted-ERM procedure that we have discussed above can be thought of as an optimal mechanism to adapt a model trained on a source data to the target data as follows.",
      "Formally, in supervised learning using a dataset , the prediction on a test datum  is made by computing:  If the class of functions that we search over to find one candidate  (say, all possible linear predictors) is large, then this search is a computationally expensive endeavor at inference time.",
      "The “weights”  of a parametric model provide a classical way to work around this issue; we can think of the weights as a statistic of the dataset , i.e., .",
      "This statistic is sufficient to predict on samples within the training set .",
      "Using this for predicting on the test set by setting  entails a loss of generality and causes the gap between population risk and empirical risk in (6) but these weights conveniently separate the training and inference phases.",
      "This same argument holds for transfer learning where the weights  are learned using a source dataset and adapted, e.g., using mini-batch updates, to new data from the target dataset.",
      "Explicitly searching for the weights using both the source and target data, like we do in weighted-ERM in (8) is at least as good as adapting the weights trained on the source data.",
      "This is an instance of the data processing inequality.",
      "In other words, we can prove that the population risk of the solution obtained from (8) is at least as good as the one obtained using transfer learning techniques.",
      "There are a number of theoretical and empirical works in the machine learning literature which have argued this point for transfer learning, meta-learning and few-shot learning and continual learning."

      "We next asked whether this increase/decrease switch effect of cannabinoids might bear behavioral relevance.",

      "This indicates a first mechanistic difference between physiological control of NOR performance by the endocannabinoid signaling (mtCB1 receptor-independent, Fig. 2b) and the disrupting effect of exogenous cannabinoids on the same process (mtCB1 receptor-dependent, Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9C).",
      "Thus, we next wondered if this effect of THC might be linked to a mtCB1 receptor-dependent decrease of lactate.",
      "To address this issue, we tested whether lactate could rescue the effect of THC, similarly as it does in mice lacking CB1 receptors from astrocytes.",
      "The simultaneous administration of lactate and THC immediately after the acquisition of NOR did not alter the effect of the cannabinoid drug (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 9D).",
      "Intriguingly, however, the administration of lactate 1 h after THC completely reverted the impairment of long-term NOR performance (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 9E).",
      "Importantly, this effect of lactate was mimicked by 3,5-DHBA (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 9E), strongly suggesting that the effects of THC on NOR are due to a mtCB1 receptor-dependent decrease of lactate signaling through the HCAR1 receptor.",
      "This suggests that the rescuing effect of lactate on the THC effect might involve the PP cascade, similarly to physiological NOR memory consolidation.",

      "Background: It is assumed that speech comprehension deficits in background noise are caused by age-related or acquired hearing loss.",
      "Methods: We examined young, middle-aged, and older individuals with and without hearing threshold loss using pure-tone (PT) audiometry, short-pulsed distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (pDPOAEs), auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), speech comprehension (OLSA), and syllable discrimination in quiet and noise.",
      "Results: A noticeable decline of hearing sensitivity in extended high-frequency regions and its influence on low-frequency-induced ABRs was striking.",
      "When testing for differences in OLSA thresholds normalized for PT thresholds (PTTs), marked differences in speech comprehension ability exist not only in noise, but also in quiet, and they exist throughout the whole age range investigated.",
      "Listeners with poor speech comprehension in quiet exhibited a relatively lower pDPOAE and, thus, cochlear amplifier performance independent of PTT, smaller and delayed ABRs, and lower performance in vowel-phoneme discrimination below phase-locking limits (/o/-/u/).",
      "When OLSA was tested in noise, listeners with poor speech comprehension independent of PTT had larger pDPOAEs and, thus, cochlear amplifier performance, larger ASSR amplitudes, and higher uncomfortable loudness levels, all linked with lower performance of vowel-phoneme discrimination above the phase-locking limit (/i/-/y/).",
      "Conslusions: This study indicates that listening in noise in humans has a sizable disadvantage in envelope coding when basilar-membrane compression is compromised.",
      "Clearly, and in contrast to previous assumptions, both good and poor speech comprehension can exist independently of differences in PTTs and age, a phenomenon that urgently requires improved techniques to diagnose sound processing at stimulus onset in the clinical routine."

      "Both tau and αS are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), lacking stable secondary and tertiary structure under physiological conditions.",
      "In this study we used a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to interrogate the interaction of tau with both soluble and fibrillar αS.",
      "Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to assess the interactions of specific domains of fluorescently labeled tau with full length and C-terminally truncated αS in both monomer and fibrillar forms.",
      "We found that full-length tau as well as individual tau domains interact with monomer αS weakly, but this interaction is much more pronounced with αS aggregates. αS aggregates also mildly slow the rate of tau aggregation, although not the final degree of aggregation.",
      "Our findings suggest that co-occurrence of tau and αS in disease are more likely to occur through monomer-fiber binding interactions, rather than monomer-monomer or co-aggregation."

    "Intro": [
      "Here, we investigate the interactions of monomer tau with monomer and fibrillar αS.",
      "To determine the roles of various domains of both proteins, we use fragments of tau consisting of the PRR (tauPRR), the MTBR with R1-R4 (tau4R, also referred to as K18 in the literature) and full-length 1N4R, tau1N4R.",
      "For αS, we use N-terminally acetylated protein, either full-length or truncated at residue 100, αS1-100.",

    "Conclusion": [
      "Our results show that all tau constructs tested here interact weakly with monomer αS, with an enhanced interaction with αS seeds, particularly for tauPRR.",
      "While the MTBR is often the focus of tau studies, prior work from our lab has drawn attention to the PRR, showing that it has a critical role in binding to tubulin and tubulin polymerization, as well as in binding to the aggregation inducer, polyphosphate.",
      "Our results also suggest that the mechanism by which αS affects tau pathology is not through directly seeding tau aggregation.",
      "For example, binding of tau to fibrillar αS may sequester tau away from microtubules, increasing the likelihood of it undergoing post-translational modifications or binding to other molecules that lead to aggregation, rather than directly templating tau aggregation.",

      "What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Aβ42, defines when people are on the AD continuum.",
      "Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Aβ42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Aβ becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Aβ42 and Aβ40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF.",
      "We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport.",
      "EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse “cargos” of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted.",
      "While Aβ42 and Aβ40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process.",

      "AFM imaging of Aβ42 confirmed that fibrillar forms are present in solution when Aβ42 was incubated with plasma extracellular vesicles overnight (Figure 4) while mainly non-fibrillar forms were observed when samples of peptides were examined subsequent to the ITC experiments.",
      "Since saturation occurred after short periods of interaction (30–60 min), it was not surprising to see less mature fibril forms (Figure 5).",
      "Given the diameter differences between the EVs that comprised exosomes (30–150 nm) and microvesicles (50–1000 nm possible size, we observed 50–450 nm) and Aβ (~1.4 pm), examining both simultaneously using AFM is not possible, (unless Aβ peptides form larger aggregates, which were sometimes visible).",
      "Given that saturable binding between extracellular vesicles and Aβ40 or Aβ42 in the ITC analysis occurred at low nM concentrations of Aβ the predominance of non-fibrillar Aβ forms is also not surprising.",

      "Earlier we and others have shown that, gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, exhibits therapeutic efficacy in EAE.",
      "However, the underlying mechanism was poorly understood.",
      "Although gemfibrozil is a known ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), here, we established that oral administration of gemfibrozil preserved the integrity of blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSB), decreased the infiltration of mononuclear cells into the CNS and inhibited the disease process of EAE in both wild type and PPARα–/– mice.",
      "On the other hand, oral gemfibrozil was found ineffective in maintaining the integrity of BBB/BSB, suppressing inflammatory infiltration and reducing the disease process of EAE in mice lacking PPARβ (formerly PPARδ), indicating an important role of PPARβ/δ, but not PPARα, in gemfibrozil-mediated preservation of BBB/BSB and protection of EAE.",
      "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in the disease process of EAE/MS and we also demonstrated that oral gemfibrozil protected Tregs in WT and PPARα–/– EAE mice, but not PPARβ–/– EAE mice.",
      "Taken together, our findings suggest that gemfibrozil, a known ligand of PPARα, preserves the integrity of BBB/BSB, enriches Tregs, and inhibits the disease process of EAE via PPARβ, but not PPARα."
    ],
    "Intro": [
      "Although gemfibrozil is an agonist of PPARα, here, by inducing EAE in PPARα–/– and PPARβ–/– mice followed by gemfibrozil treatment, we demonstrated that gemfibrozil treatment required the involvement of PPARβ, but not PPARα, to restore the integrity of BBB and BSB, attenuate the inflammatory infiltration into the spinal cord, upregulate the expression of myelin-specific genes in the spinal cord, and protect mice from EAE.",
      "Gemfibrozil also involved PPARβ, but not PPARα, to enrich Foxp3+ Tregs in EAE mice.",

      "To understand the relative predictive utility of different biomarkers, we utilized random forest to predict amyloid PET abnormality as well as cognitive status.",

      "Responses that occurred ≤1.5 s after the onset of the deviant tone were classified as correct.",
      "In the temporal deviant task, all of the tones had the same pitch, and deviants were either local violations (e.g., two tones to replace a single longer-duration tone) or global violations (e.g., an extra beat in the bar, representing a deviation from the time signature).",

      "In that event, it might be necessary to explore various food textures or liquid types (e.g., carbonated or thickened liquids), that might enhance an individual’s ability to sense the food or liquid and better control swallow functioning.",
      "In speech, reduced tongue somatosensation likely influences low vowel production, due to less contact with molars compared to high vowels, resulting in lower speech intelligibility.",
      "Speech interventions that rely on touch cues (e.g.,) will likely be less effective if individuals cannot sense the intended cues.",
      "In that event, service provision might target awareness of relative locations of jaw vs. tongue, using activities that focus on awareness of tongue and jaw location during speech, and use AAC or video modeling in that process.",
      "In language and literacy, if certain sounds are more difficult to produce due to somatosensory limitations, both vocabulary and syntax may be compromised due to avoidance of words or morphemes containing those sounds, and these same challenges may lead to difficulty with phoneme-grapheme acquisition as well as oral reading (reading aloud).",

      "We first downloaded 48 snRNA-seq samples (24 AD and 24 control) and uniformly re-processed them with strict QCs.",
      "Next, we identified canonical cell types and their subclasses, consistent with cell type definitions from BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN).",
      "With such uniformly processed data, we built a high-confidence cell-to-cell communication network composed of signaling genes and inferred the major signaling pathway patterns in AD and healthy brains separately.",
      "Interestingly, we found that healthy brains form clear C2C patterns with distinct signaling usage, which has been significantly disrupted in AD brains.",
      "When compared to control, Alzheimer’s excitatory cell types seem to be sending more communication signals specifically to the inhibitory cell types, while inhibitory and non-neuronal cell types globally decreased their outgoing signals to most cell types.",

      "In summary, with the novel advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, we show that cellular signaling is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner and that improper regulation of extracellular signaling genes is linked to intracellular risk genes, garnering cross-cell-type mechanistic insights behind Alzheimer’s Disease."
