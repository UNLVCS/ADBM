Serious Health-related Suffering (SHS) is a novel methodology to measure\\n                the palliative care need and was originally developed by The Lancet Commission on\\n                Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief. In 2015, the first iteration\\n                – SHS 1.0 – was estimated at over 61 million people\\n                worldwide experiencing at least 6 billion days of SHS annually as a result of\\n                life-limiting and life-threatening conditions.', 'Objectives.', 'In this paper, an updated methodology - SHS 2.0 - is presented building on the\\n                work of the Lancet Commission and detailing calculations, data requirements,\\n                limitations, and assumptions.', 'Methods and Results.', 'The updates to the original methodology focus on measuring the number of people\\n                who die with (decedents) or live with (non-decedents) SHS in a given year to assess\\n                the number of people in need of palliative care across health conditions and\\n                populations.

However, most reside in low-resource and rural\\n                areas with nonexistent or inadequate palliative care services and limited access to\\n                medicines and technologies that can reduce SHS, emblematic of the tragedy and\\n                injustice of overall disparities in healthcare. Palliative care is a core component\\n                of universal health coverage (UHC), making the lack of access to palliative care a\\n                serious impediment to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, namely, to\\n                “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all\\n                ages” and to achieving SDG 10 focused on reducing inequality within and\\n                among all countries.', 'Efforts to address this global health failing and to close the divide in access to\\n                palliative care have been thwarted by various factors. One is the dearth of methods\\n                and data to quantify global palliative care need and this was a major area of work\\n                of The Lancet Commission on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief\\n                (hereafter referred to as Lancet Commission or the Commission) in developing SHS.\\n                Although evidence is required to develop appropriate and targeted recommendations\\n                for closing gaps in access to palliative care, measurement of the burden of SHS has\\n                not kept pace with progress in measuring the burden of disease. A scientific focus\\n                on measurement of SHS is a necessary complement to existing measures of the burden\\n                of disease such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability adjusted life\\n                years (DALYs). Further, measurement of SHS has value and purpose in its own right as\\n                a global health issue and as part of efforts to achieve the SDGs.', 'The Lancet Commission report presented a breakthrough by introducing the concept\\n                of serious health-related suffering (SHS) to quantify the global and\\n                country-specific need for palliative care and pain relief in terms of both the\\n                number of individuals who experience SHS (population in need of palliative care\\n                services), and the number of days of each type of SHS (as an input to develop more\\n                effective health system responses to address palliative care need) in a given year.\\n                Building on more limited efforts to measure population-based need for palliative\\n                care in previous publications, the Commission estimated the 2015 global burden of\\n                SHS at 61 million: 25.5 million people who died—45% of the 56.2 million\\n                deaths worldwide and an additional 35.5 million people who experienced an\\n                SHS-associated condition and did not die in that year, with at least 6 billion\\n                symptom days experienced by those people. The estimates were calculated by a\\n                systematic process documented briefly in the Lancet Commission report and in its\\n                entirety in a white paper.', 'The Lancet Commission Report has been cited by over 1000 research article\\n                publications as of this writing, and the data has been used by various international\\n                organizations and initiatives including the International Narcotic Control Board\\n                (INCB), the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance (WHPCA), and the Disease\\n                Control Priorities (3rd edition), as well as various country champions of palliative\\n                care in their evidence generation, policy making and advocacy endeavors.', 'The Lancet Commission Secretariat was transformed into an interdisciplinary\\n                Research Hub on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief—jointly\\n                led by the University of Miami Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas and the\\n                International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care to promote evidence\\n                generation, dissemination, and translation to policy and practice to achieve\\n                universal access to palliative care. The research hub built on the original\\n                Commission methodology—SHS 1.0 to generate the next\\n                iteration—SHS 2.0.', 'In this paper, the SHS 2.0 methodology is summarized, exclusively dealing with\\n                measuring the number of people who die with (decedents) or live with (non-decedents)\\n                SHS. The assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of both the original and the 2.0\\n                iteration for measuring people with SHS are discussed. The methodology for measuring\\n                the number of days of SHS is also detailed. Pioneered by the Lancet Commission,\\n                measuring days with SHS is essential for determining the health system responses to\\n                palliative care need and although not undertaken as part of SHS 2.0, must be a\\n                priority for future methodological work on SHS. A guide to calculating the burden of\\n                SHS is provided, including specific instructions on measuring the number of people\\n                who die with (decedents) or live with (non-decedents) SHS and the number of symptom\\n                days they experience annually, as well as secondary indicators that may be\\n                constructed with the SHS database. The paper concludes with a discussion on the\\n                potential applications of SHS data for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners\\n                as well as directions for future work and priorities for developing SHS 3.0. It is\\n                linked to another methods paper on measuring distributed opioid morphine equivalent\\n                (DOME) and comparing DOME against the need for palliative care (SHS).', 'Defining and Measuring SHS', 'Serious health-related suffering, as defined by the Lancet Commission, is the\\n                “pain, suffering, and severe distress associated with life-threatening\\n                or life-limiting health conditions and with end of life” that cannot be\\n                relieved without medical intervention and that is potentially amenable to relief\\n                through palliative care. SHS is not bound by time or prognosis and includes complex,\\n                chronic or acute, life threatening, or life-limiting health conditions.', 'The definition of palliative care adopted by the Lancet Commission is the one used\\n                by the World Health Organization (WHO) at the time: “an approach that\\n                improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems\\n                associated with life-threatening illness through the prevention and relief of\\n                suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and\\n                other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual.” SHS 2.0 adopts\\n                the consensus-based definition spearheaded by the IAHPC that was initiated as one of\\n                the recommendations of the Commission report and engaged a group of global\\n                stakeholders from low, middle, and high-income countries. Specifically,\\n                “palliative care is the active holistic care of individuals across all\\n                ages with serious health-related suffering due to severe illness and especially of\\n                those near the end of life. It aims to improve the quality of life of patients,\\n                their families, and their caregivers.”', 'The SHS burden is presented both as the number of people experiencing SHS due to\\n                life-limiting or life-threatening conditions and as the number of symptomdays of SHS\\n                experienced. Individuals experiencing SHS are distinguished as either decedents or\\n                non-decedents and the conditions, multipliers, and estimates in each differ.\\n                Decedents are defined as individuals who died within the year of calculation and are\\n                thus captured in the mortality database. Non-decedents are individuals who did not\\n                die within the year of calculation and are thus captured in the prevalence database.\\n                Non-decedent categories of SHS include conditions (1) that may have been cured but\\n                from which SHS persists; (2) from which patients recover but that nonetheless caused\\n                SHS; (3) with survival with chronic severe disability and with SHS symptoms; and (4)\\n                have a slowly progressive course. Symptom-days are defined as the number of days\\n                decedents and non-decedents lived with any symptoms and are calculated for each\\n                symptom and aggregated to measure total palliative care need. The latter is key to\\n                analyzing the response to SHS, for example in DOME for specific symptoms such as\\n                pain or dyspnea.', 'General Considerations in the Selection Processes', 'The selection of conditions, development of multipliers, and calculation of the\\n                number of people and days of SHS was informed by a literature search, individual and\\n                group expert discussions, and Delphi processes with online surveys for SHS 1.0 as\\n                described in the Appendix to the Commission report. Expert panel (s) of palliative\\n                care clinicians with experience providing clinical care in different parts of the\\n                world, especially in LMICs were engaged in the process.', 'To estimate symptoms and symptom duration (days of SHS), as part of the work of\\n                the Commission and SHS1.0, experts were asked to consider a typical patient with\\n                each of the conditions and based on their daily experience, to generate an estimate\\n                of the prevalence and duration of each symptom. During the expert consultation\\n                stage, including focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews, results\\n                from the literature review were presented. Experts were asked to provide responses\\n                and feedback based on their work experiences even when those experiences were\\n                contrary to the evidence presented to them. Either individually or in groups, all\\n                data and estimates were vetted, considering assumptions and limitations or gaps to\\n                ensure that all relevant aspects or scenarios are reasonably accounted for when\\n                possible. It is expected that these data will serve to provide content validity for\\n                estimation of the global burden of remediable suffering. See Appendix Table 1 for a\\n                full list of the experts’ consensus building practices undertaken by the\\n                Lancet Commission.', 'Finally, the Delphi method for consensus-building also was used to determine the\\n                duration (average number of days requiring palliative care) for which palliative\\n                care was needed for each of the conditions included in the database. Experts were\\n                purposively sampled and were considered to be “informed\\n                individuals” and “specialists” within the field\\n                of palliative care, in this case palliative care. Both rounds of the Delphi\\n                requested 18 palliative care experts living in LMICs to estimate the number of days\\n                of palliative care that would be required for a patient with each of the given\\n                conditions. The responses from the first round were pooled to identify a group\\n                average range and standard deviation for each condition. The second round of the\\n                Delphi presented respondents with the average range of days of palliative care with\\n                confidence intervals for each parameter. Experts were asked to respond again to the\\n                same questions based on knowledge of the group’s prior responses. The\\n                response rate for round one was 83% and for round two was 27%. Results from each\\n                round are presented in Table 2. See Appendix Table 2 for the results from rounds 1\\n                and 2 of the Delphi study. Due to limited resources, estimation for symptom-days is\\n                only available from the Lancet Commission (SHS 1.0) and was not updated for SHS 2.0.', 'Taking Children in Account in SHS 2.0', 'The initial SHS database from the Commission work did not differentiate the SHS\\n                burden experienced by adults and children. Hence for SHS 2.0 and in collaboration\\n                with and under the leadership of the International Childrens Palliative Care Network\\n                (ICPCN) with the engagement of IAHPC and WHPCA, an additional expert panel was\\n                convened for SHS 2.0 comprised of 8 pediatric palliative care specialists from both\\n                high-income and low- and middle-income settings around the world. Literature review\\n                and analysis, an online survey, two virtual meetings each lasting at least 90\\n                minutes, and various internal discussions were conducted to differentiate the\\n                calculation of palliative care needs for children and adults in select conditions.', 'Time-Series Analysis', 'A major improvement for SHS 2.0 is the time-series analysis to incorporate the\\n                sensitivity of SHS to changes in disease trajectories, changes in pathogens,\\n                emergence of new diseases, and with the evolution of and advancements in medical\\n                technologies to address the burden of disease, each of which impacts the SHS burden.\\n                This gap was identified through the incorporation of time series mortality and\\n                prevalence data to analyze historical trends in the SHS burden. Data for 1990, 2000,\\n                2010, and 2019 are presented in the updated calculations. Those years were selected\\n                to represent the earliest obtainable evidence, and data points every 10 years, and\\n                2019 was selected as the most recent year since it was the most updated year of data\\n                at the time of the commencement of this analysis. The need to account for endogenous\\n                variables was particularly evident for people living with human immunodeficiency\\n                viruses (PLHIV), as well as patients living with tuberculosis, cancer, or\\n                cerebrovascular disease, and for children.', 'Switching From WHO’s Global Health Estimates (GHE) to\\n                IHME’s Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Database', 'The Lancet Commission estimated the SHS burden in the most recent year of\\n                available data at the time (2015) and using WHO’s global mortality\\n                database, Global Health Estimates (GHE). However, due to the lack of prevalence data\\n                in GHE, non-decedents were computed using fixed survivor-to-deaths ratios generated\\n                from global disease-specific reports. This assumed that all countries experience the\\n                global average survivor-to-deaths ratio for all conditions with non-decedents\\n                categories, not accounting for country-level variation in the epidemiological\\n                profile of survivors and limiting the applicability of country-specific analyses.', 'SHS 2.0 was improved in several dimensions by using the GBD database released by\\n                the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Firstly, the GBD includes\\n                country-specific data on mortality and prevalence. The prevalence of data\\n                strengthens the calculation of non-decedents with SHS. In addition, GBD data dates\\n                back to 1990, permitting the calculation of the burden of SHS over three decades.\\n                Further, the Lancet Commission report defined children as being 0–15\\n                years of age as more disaggregated data was not available. For SHS 2.0, children are\\n                defined as 0–19-year-old to be consistent with other key publications on\\n                children’s palliative care need around the world using the GBD data\\n                break-down of age groups.', 'Several other global databases have also been used for SHS 2.0 in order to compile\\n                better, country- and disease-specific mortality or prevalence data.

The global SHS 2.0 database includes 21\\n                conditions, and these are presented in Table 1 with their corresponding ICD-10 codes\\n                and GBD codes. All 21 groups of conditions include decedent categories, considering\\n                that at least a proportion of people dying from those conditions suffer from serious\\n                health-related suffering. In addition, non-decedent categories of SHS are included\\n                for some of the 21 conditions that: may have been cured but from which SHS persists\\n                (drug-resistant tuberculosis, some hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, some\\n                malignancies, some inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system); from which\\n                patients recover but that caused SHS (serious injuries, renal failures, preterm\\n                birth complications, and birth trauma); with survival with chronic severe disability\\n                and with SHS symptoms (cerebrovascular disease, leukemia, congenital malformations,\\n                injury, birth trauma, human immunodeficiency viruses/acquired immunodeficiency\\n                syndrome (HIV/AIDS), some musculoskeletal disorders, liver diseases); and, have a\\n                slowly progressive course (malignancies, dementia, Parkinson’s disease,\\n                multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, thalassemia, and sickle cell disorders).', 'In the original Lancet Commission report, the non-decedents category for 11\\n                conditions were considered. In SHS 2.0, non-decedents categories for four more\\n                conditions were added and differentiating factors were used that are important to\\n                estimating suffering patterns. Table 2 provides a detailed description of how\\n                decedents and non-decedents in need of palliative care are estimated for each\\n                condition as well as key literature and extra databases used to calculate the\\n                decedents and non-decedents with SHS. Conditions are ranked using the alphabetical\\n                order of their ICD-10 codes.', 'As the result of the exercise to estimate palliative care needs for children,\\n                there was consensus that the following conditions be added due to their substantive\\n                contribution to SHS among children for both decedents and non-decedents: (1)\\n                diabetes mellitus, (2) sickle cell disorders, (3) thalassemia, and the following\\n                conditions for non-decedents categories of: (1) leukemia, (2) liver diseases, (3)\\n                chronic kidney diseases, (4) neonatal preterm birth and birth trauma. Hence, while\\n                SHS 1.0 included 20 conditions, SHS 2.0 includes 21 groups of conditions with the\\n                addition of endocrine, metabolic, blood, and immune disorders which include diabetes\\n                mellitus, sickle cell disorders, and thalassemia for decedents and non-decedents.', 'The review of the case of diabetes in children prompted an overall review of the\\n                included conditions. For diabetes mellitus in adults, deaths from sequelae are\\n                attributed to the proximal cause and hence considered captured in other conditions\\n                included in the SHS database and specifically, cerebrovascular disease,\\n                cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure, chronic ischemic heart disease, renal failure,\\n                and atherosclerosis. Because deaths from diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic\\n                hyperosmotic non-ketotic syndrome typically result in death so rapidly that there is\\n                no time to institute quality palliative care services, these conditions are not\\n                included. In the pediatric population, diabetes mellitus is added due to the\\n                concerns over pain and suffering caused by type-1 diabetes even in the absence of\\n                organ complications.', 'Efforts to alleviate SHS experienced by a newborn, the assurance of the\\n                newborn’s comfort and that of distraught parents should accompany\\n                aggressive life-sustaining treatments if they are to reasonably provide more benefit\\n                than burden. Palliative care must also be available as an alternative to potentially\\n                harmful life-sustaining interventions when a newborn is moribund. Hence, in both SHS\\n                1.0 and SHS 2.0, extremely premature and very low birth weight newborns whose\\n                survival is unlikely, and babies born with severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or\\n                congenital anomalies not compatible with life are included in the list of SHS\\n                conditions.', 'In both SHS 1.0 and SHS 2.0, leukemia is considered a separate condition than the\\n                rest of the malignancies due to its distinctive patients’ demographics\\n                and suffering patterns.', 'Selection of Types or Symptoms of Suffering', 'Patients’ suffering varies by type, severity, and duration and a\\n                clinically, economically, and strategically useful measure of SHS requires\\n                estimation of not only the number of patients who suffer, but also the type of\\n                suffering and duration of suffering. Therefore, overarching categories of suffering\\n                were identified in SHS 1.0 and then within those categories, the types or symptoms\\n                were associated with each condition.', 'Palliative care literature typically divides suffering into four\\n                categories—physical, psychological, social, and spiritual to encompass\\n                the full spectrum of human suffering. While the Lancet Commission accepted and\\n                adopted all four categories as SHS, the focus was on estimating the prevalence and\\n                duration of only physical and psychological categories of suffering and\\n                corresponding symptoms. The empirical evidence from published literature or\\n                expertise to produce reasonable estimates of the prevalence and duration of each\\n                type of social and spiritual suffering were not sufficient.', 'To estimate SHS as precisely as possible, the Commissions expert group identified\\n                the most common symptoms of physical and psychological suffering, and then estimated\\n                the prevalence and duration of each type of suffering associated with each condition\\n                or its treatment. Through literature review and evidence-informed expert consensus\\n                building exercises, physical and psychological types of suffering (symptoms), their\\n                frequencies and durations for each condition were identified as part of Commission\\n                work. See Fig. 1 for details. Specifically, the types of physical suffering include\\n                moderate or severe pain, mild pain, weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea\\n                and vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, itching, wounds, and bleeding. The\\n                types of psychological suffering identified include anxiety and worry, depressed\\n                mood, delirium or confusion, and dementia with disorientation, agitation, or memory\\n                loss. Table 3 summarizes the duration of each type of physical and psychological\\n                suffering and Appendix Table 3 lists the results from the literature review on\\n                prevalence of the most commonly reported type of physical suffering among patients\\n                with serious, complex, or life-limiting health problem.', 'Most published data on symptom prevalence comes from high or upper-middle income\\n                countries where both disease-modifying and palliative treatments are most\\n                accessible. Furthermore, most of the literature either focused on physical and\\n                psychological symptoms among a single group of patients (such as cancer), or a\\n                single symptom (such as pain) in patients with various conditions. Data, mostly from\\n                high income countries, indicates that well over 50% of people who die of or live\\n                with malignant neoplasms and AIDS experience pain, and that pain is also common\\n                among those who live with heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\n                (COPD), renal failure, neurologic disease and dementia. Dyspnea (shortness of\\n                breath) is especially common among people who live with COPD and heart failure and\\n                only slightly less common among those who live with malignant neoplasms and AIDS.\\n                Depressed mood and anxiety are widespread among patients with a variety of advanced\\n                life-threatening illnesses including metastatic cancer and trauma. There are fewer\\n                studies among patients with most other serious, complex, or life-limiting health\\n                problems.', 'Of note, dementia appears both in the list of conditions (Alzheimer’s\\n                disease and other primary dementias) and as a symptom of other conditions (HIV/AIDS,\\n                cerebrovascular disease, and other neurologic conditions). The term dementia is\\n                therefore used in two ways, and the distinction in use of each instance is required.', 'Identifying Multipliers for Each Condition', 'The next step in measuring SHS was to determine the proportion of people with each\\n                condition who experience SHS. These are called multipliers. Multipliers are\\n                mathematical factors that estimate number of people dying or living with SHS based\\n                on different data sources. They reflect different strategies applied in the\\n                estimation and are provided separately for decedents and non-decedents. For\\n                decedents, the multipliers are always a percentage between 0 and 100%, to be applied\\n                to total deaths. For non-decedents, the multipliers take one of the three different\\n                forms: (1) a percentage between 0 and 100% to be applied to total number of patients\\n                living with the disease; (2) a ratio that can go over 100% to be applied to total\\n                deaths; or (3) a ratio that can go over 100% to be applied to total decedents in\\n                need of palliative care. See Table 4 with more details.', 'To identify the proportion of people with each condition who experience SHS for\\n                the different conditions and sub-conditions and therefore identify appropriate\\n                multipliers to use for each, an extensive literature review was conducted for both\\n                decedents and non-decedents. Empirical evidence of symptom burden for some\\n                conditions was identified, but most studies were conducted in high-income settings.\\n                Evidence identified from the literature could not directly be used as multipliers\\n                since much of it was focused on patients in a certain stage of care whilst the SHS\\n                calculation requires multipliers for both people who die within that\\n                year—decedents and another for people who live with a\\n                condition—non-decedents. As a result, empirical evidence on percentage\\n                of patients with each condition experiencing SHS from the literature review were\\n                summarized and presented as the basis of discussion in various expert consensus\\n                building exercises. When estimating the SHS burden of non-decedents, experts were\\n                asked to consider the SHS burden of an “average” patient for\\n                each condition among all patients living with that condition who are not in their\\n                last year of life.', 'Because SHS 2.0 incorporates analysis across a number of years, it was possible to\\n                implement improvements to the multipliers for HIV and tuberculosis (TB). SHS\\n                stemming from HIV among non-decedents was differentiated between individuals\\n                undergoing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) from those who are not, reflecting how\\n                the advent of ART and increased access to such treatment revolutionized care for\\n                PLWHIV and in turn, SHS associated with HIV. Furthermore, extensively drug-resistant\\n                TB (XDR-TB) is differentiated from multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), because\\n                antimicrobial resistance and the rise of XDR TB pose major challenges to treatment\\n                of tuberculosis which is different from MDR-TB.', 'For cancer, SHS 2.0 also incorporates data across additional years for the\\n                estimation of multipliers. In SHS 2.0, unlike for the Commission report, five-year\\n                survival data were used to estimate non-decedent SHS for malignant neoplasms and\\n                leukemia. The GBD data reports only overall survival and does not further\\n                disaggregate by years since diagnosis. Hence, the GBD data were adjusted based on\\n                the prevalence and mortality data extracted from the Global Cancer Observatory\\n                (GLOBOCAN) 2018 (see Panel 1 and Table 4) that report cancer survivorship for 1, 3,\\n                and 5 years from diagnosis.', 'A country-specific linearly interpolated trend was applied to estimate prevalence\\n                for year 2 and 4 post diagnosis. The approximation of survival was estimated as the\\n                ratio between the total deaths and the prevalence in the same period. Last, to\\n                estimate non-decedent burden for 1990, 2000, and 2010 given that information on\\n                5-year prevalence and survival is not available by year since diagnosis, the\\n                GLOBOCAN 2018 data are adjusted using country-income specific quintile distribution\\n                data on percentages of all cancer survivors being with each year of diagnosis (see\\n                Table 5 for detail).', 'Cerebrovascular diseases constitute a major component of overall SHS, yet its\\n                non-decedent category was a limitation in SHS 1.0. For SHS 2.0, non-decedent SHS was\\n                calculated for patients living in the year prior to their last year of life,\\n                assuming that most patients who live for extended periods with this condition do not\\n                experience SHS (as the condition is largely asymptomatic until it becomes serious\\n                enough to result in death). Still, data are scarce on the proportion of\\n                cerebrovascular disease patients in the final years of life and hence with SHS. An\\n                estimate of the proportion of patients who are diagnosed and die in the same year\\n                was developed based on a literature search focusing on differences by country income\\n                level and this was applied to two years of cerebrovascular disease mortality (see\\n                Tables 6, 7, and Appendix Table 4). Because data were not available on the number of\\n                deaths per year of patients diagnosed in the last year, a literature search was\\n                carried out on the survival of these patients in countries by income level. In other\\n                words, the calculation factored in the percentage of newly diagnosed patients that\\n                would die within one year as the percentage among all deaths that would occur due to\\n                newly diagnosed patients. As literature covering all income groups was not available\\n                in all years of interest, i.e., 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2019, missing years and income\\n                groups were imputed to the nearest income group and/or to all the year (Tables 8 and\\n                9). The new method limited the estimation of SHS only to patients within the last\\n                1–2 years of their life, since most patients living with cerebrovascular\\n                disease can spend years living without SHS. While this method gives us a more\\n                realistic estimate of the suffering endured by cerebrovascular disease patients,\\n                there is little literature to report an estimate of the percentage of total\\n                cerebrovascular disease patients who are in the last 1–2 years of their\\n                life (Appendix Table 4). Therefore, we applied a series of assumptions plus a\\n                limited compilation of data from our literature review to construct the matrix of\\n                percentages of cerebrovascular disease patients living within the last\\n                1–2 years of their life by income group, to 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2019.\\n                These assumptions are limitations of this study, given the varying strength of the\\n                underlying data.', 'Table 7 presents the multipliers used to calculate SHS for all 21 conditions,\\n                separating decedents and non-decedents.', 'Data Limitations and Future Iterations', 'The measurement of the global burden of SHS presented in the Lancet Commission\\n                report set a precedent and the update to SHS 2.0 is an important move forward in\\n                measuring the number of people in need of palliative care.

Some of the most persistent and common complaints of this post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) are cognitive in nature, described subjectively as “brain fog” and also objectively measured as deficits in executive function, working memory, attention, and processing speed. The mechanisms of these chronic cognitive sequelae are currently not understood. SARS-CoV-2 inflicts damage to cerebral blood vessels and the intestinal wall by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and also by evoking production of high levels of systemic cytokines, compromising the brain’s neurovascular unit, degrading the intestinal barrier, and potentially increasing the permeability of both to harmful substances. Such substances are hypothesized to be produced in the gut by pathogenic microbiota that, given the profound effects COVID-19 has on the gastrointestinal system, may fourish as a result of intestinal post-COVID-19 dysbiosis. COVID-19 may therefore create a scenario in which neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory substances readily proliferate from the gut lumen and encounter a weakened neurovascular unit, gaining access to the brain and subsequently producing cognitive deficits. Here, we review this proposed PACS pathogenesis along the gut-brain axis, while also identifying specific methodologies that are currently available to experimentally measure each individual component of the model.'], 'annotation': [{'1': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Species', 'offset': '114', 'length': '11', 'text': 'coronavirus'}, '2': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Species', 'offset': '153', 'length': '8', 'text': 'patients'}, '3': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Species', 'offset': '227', 'length': '47', 'text': 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2'}, '4': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Species', 'offset': '276', 'length': '10', 'text': 'SARS-CoV-2'}, '5': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Species', 'offset': '655', 'length': '10', 'text': 'SARS-CoV-2'}, '15': {'identifier': None, 'type': 'Gene', 'offset': '453', 'length': '3', 'text': 'fog'}}]}, 'INTRO': {'text': ['Introduction', 'The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and has the hallmark clinical presentation of pulmonary complications that range from mild hypoxia to pneumonia to acute respiratory distress. Given the potentially life-threatening severities of COVID-19, most of the research immediately following the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak was focused on the acute disease stage. However, reports of lasting effects began to emerge shortly after the beginning of the pandemic, leading the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to define “long COVID-19” as symptoms lasting beyond 3\\u2009months. Such effects were quickly found to not necessarily limit themselves to the lungs. Many of the persistent symptoms involve the central nervous and the gastrointestinal systems, including fatigue, brain fog, irritable bowel syndrome, and dyspepsia. Here we discuss a multi-system constellation of residual SARS-CoV-2 effects that can remain after the acute stage and may lead to the emergence and maintenance of chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Specifically, we focus on the lasting neurocognitive sequelae that often follow COVID-19, and provide an overview of their proposed pathogenesis along the gut-brain axis.', 'Subsequent to the acute stage of COVID-19, up to 30% of patients report long-term symptoms, despite the initial infection being resolved and the virus no longer being detectable in the body. As such, while the epidemiological waves of SARS-CoV-2 have come and gone, the number of individuals suffering from its chronic sequelae has been increasing cumulatively during and after the pandemic, with the CDC estimating that approximately 1 in 13 adults in the US have long COVID-19 at the time of this writing. The pathogenesis of these residual effects of COVID-19 remains unclear, and few tools are currently available to address this looming global health crisis. As such, the described gut-brain model may motivate novel applications for existing gastrointestinal therapies in order to indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially alleviating the neurocognitive sequelae of COVID-19. We note that the CDC recently approved an ICD-10 code for Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC); however, other definitions such as Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) and Post COVID-19 Conditions (PCC) are also common in clinical and scientific communications. With long COVID nomenclature remaining somewhat ambiguous, the authors of this manuscript refer to the condition as PACS.', 'Gut-brain axis model of PACS', 'Described initially as general symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the definitive clinical presentation of long COVID-19 remains elusive. Cognitive issues are frequently reported, including memory loss and brain fog, with patients over the age of 65 reporting more severe acute- and chronic-stage symptomology. Long COVID also appears to involve developing new-onset conditions such as diabetes, thrombotic, and cerebrovascular disease. As discussed below in more detail, there is compelling evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises intestinal epithelium and cerebrovascular endothelium – both directly and indirectly – lending support to the PACS pathogenesis model based on dysfunctional gut-brain interactions due to damage to the neurovascular unit and intestinal barrier. Specifically, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that SARS-CoV-2 relies on for cellular entry are widely expressed by cerebrovascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and have been implicated in both direct viral damage to the neurovascular unit and indirect damage via virus-induced cytokine storms. The intestinal wall is also rich with ACE2 receptors, making it vulnerable to viral infiltration that can damage the intestinal barrier and increase its systemic permeability. Further, common COVID-19 gastrointestinal disturbances often produce dysbiosis – a shift toward pathological, pro-inflammatory, and potentially neurotoxic gut microbiota. Collectively, COVID-19 may thus create a scenario in which neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory substances systemically permeate from the gut lumen through the damaged intestinal barrier and produce chronic cognitive symptoms of PACS by accessing the brain via weakened cerebral vasculature – damaged both directly by the virus as well as indirectly via dysregulated cytokine activity.', 'Neuronal and cerebrovascular components of PACS', 'Regarding direct SARS-CoV-2 infiltration of the brain', 'We note that while most investigations to-date have failed to detect widespread SARS-CoV-2 distributions in neuronal or glial cells, some evidence exists of viral entry into the central nervous system via the olfactory bulb – a path that may be related to anosmia that is common in COVID-19. Specifically, several autopsy studies have provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 tropism from the olfactory bulb into the brainstem – a brain region that has a relatively high expression of ACE2 receptors. Such evidence includes brainstem neurodegeneration and presence of viral RNA in the brainstem, with higher concentrations specifically in the medullar subregion. However, brainstem neuropathology has also been described in deceased COVID-19 patients’ brains with no detectable viral RNA to accompany such findings, giving credence to hypotheses of indirect neurological damage. Direct viral pathogenesis for chronic long COVID-19 is particularly unlikely since the acute disease that precedes PACS is often mild in its severity, motivating our indirect model along the gut-brain axis. Such indirect pathogenic effects can occur due to several COVID-19 comorbidities that have well-established neurological sequelae, and include neuroinflammation, metabolic abnormalities, and cerebrovascular dysfunction.', 'The aforementioned brainstem findings in long COVID-19 are consistent with its cognitive symptomology that largely revolves around fatigue and brain fog, reflecting prior reports of brainstem abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Other neuroimaging findings are consistent with this clinical presentation as well, with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) based microstructural changes reported in the thalamus – another region extensively implicated in CFS. Using DWI, post-COVID-19 changes have also been reported in multiple major white matter bundles that connect distant cortical parts of the brain, including the corona radiata, corticospinal tract, corpus callosum, arcuate fasciculus, cingulate, fornix, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. In addition to microstructural changes, MRI-based volumetric and density effects of COVID-19 have also been reported across multiple brain regions; however, effect directions have been inconsistent. Nevertheless, such neuroimaging-based findings have been consistently reported following mild COVID-19 cases, and the extent of such brain changes appear to reflect the severities of acute-stage disease. However, with direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain being an unlikely culprit in PACS, the process by which the virus produces its neurological sequelae remains unclear, motivating the indirect gut-brain axis hypothesis described here.', 'Cerebrovascular damage and inflammation', 'Despite its apparent multi-faceted effects on the central nervous system, it remains unknown how COVID-19 produces its neurocognitive deficits. Early post-mortem investigations of fatal COVID-19 cases suggested that direct infections may indeed occur, yet these cases followed severe and rapid disease progressions, and were accompanied by classic symptoms of brain infections such as encephalitis and cerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, we argue that damage to the cerebrovascular endothelium plays a major role in underpinning the various sequelae of COVID-19 in the brain. Early histopathological studies of severe COVID-19 showed endothelial injury that co-localized with cerebrovascular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors as well as the resulting viral interactions with the tissue. SARS-CoV-2 thus appears to directly bind to the endothelium, possibly compromising the blood brain barrier (BBB) and exposing the brain to harmful substances that may be present systemically, activating immune resident cells and leading to neuroinflammation. While such systemic compounds are described in further detail below, we note that the viral spike protein itself has been speculated to permeate the damaged BBB and to be involved in microglial activation, with subsequent chronic neuroinflammation likely leading to neuronal damage and contributing to PACS neurocognitive effects such as fatigue and brain fog.', 'Existing work also highlights the role of perivascular inflammation in endothelial dysfunction after COVID-19. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-4 are abundantly released in the context of systemic inflammation associated with acute-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection, and often remain elevated chronically as well. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) help maintain such inflammatory profiles long-term, leaving pro-inflammatory imprints in monocytes that produce long-lasting, aberrant immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, with such MDM responses common even in patients who experience mild COVD-19. Specifically, SARS-COV-2 spike protein stimulation produces profound cytokine release in macrophages derived from COVID-19 patients, but not those derived from controls who were never infected. Leukotrienes (LTs) produced by white blood cells have also been reported to induce and elevate levels of chemokine ligand 2 and fatty acid synthesis in monocytes and leukocytes, suggesting that enhanced LT synthesis may drive exaggerated pro-inflammatory chemokine responses in post COVID-19 MDMs. Indeed, this long-term presence of proinflammatory compounds in itself has been shown to inflict damage to cerebrovascular endothelium following COVID-19 as well as other infections, exposing the brain to systemic harmful substances and virions via the compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB).', 'Microglial release of cytokines further compounds the inflammatory effects on cerebrovascular endothelium described above, also downregulating astrocytic and pre-synaptic expression of glutamate transporter-1. This in turn leads to disruption of glutamatergic pathways that can potentially induce neuronal excitotoxicity, degeneration, and death. The role of such glutamatergic dysfunction has recently been implicated in PACS neurocognitive symptomology specifically within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – a brain region that is part of the executive function network and is involved in complex integration of multimodal information. Further, the resulting endothelial dysfunction in the brain would be expected to disrupt cerebrovascular autoregulation of blood flow on a broader level, producing lingering neurocognitive effects due to neuronal malnourishment. Crucially, this notion is supported by the increased rates of other, more severe types cerebrovascular pathology associated with COVID-19 such as stroke and microhemorrhage. Collectively, endothelial dysfunction in PACS likely maintains its neurological sequelae via at least the following three ways: 1) exposure of the brain via compromised BBB to harmful substances that 2) accumulate due to inadequate cerebrovascular mechanical action necessary for glymphatic removal of byproducts, reflecting blood dysregulation that 3) malnourishes brain tissue and leads to neuronal dysfunction.', 'Neuroimaging of cerebral vasculature and Neuroinflammation', 'Non-invasive assessment of the neurovascular unit remains elusive. While using gadolinium enhanced imaging to assess blood–brain barrier integrity for research purposes has become controversial due to its toxicity, novel techniques such as diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeled perfusion are emerging. A promising technique for assessing the integrity of the neurovascular unit indirectly is MRI-based cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) imaging, which measures the hemodynamic response to hypercapnia – increased partial pressure of blood CO2 – that induces vasodilation-related changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Breathing a weak gas mixture of CO2, a rapid and potent vasodilator, during neuroimaging allows for measurement of a functional vascular response, which stands in contrast to static CBF measures obtained using arterial spin labeling and transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Like conventional functional MRI, CVR also offers voxel-wise quantification of reactivity. In light of these advantages, the technique has seen increased utility in pathologies related to brain vasculature, such as stroke, small vessel disease, traumatic brain injury, and age-related cognitive impairments. Given the profound multi-organ vascular effects of COVID-19, CVR is an ideal tool for examining cerebrovascular function in PACS patients. Quantifying systemic Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) may complement neuroimaging methods such as CVR in assessing the neurovascular unit, specifically with regard to astrocytic roles in BBB integrity. Astrocytes contribute necessary, non-redundant roles in neurovascular unit maintenance by regulating intercellular endothelial associations in BBB tight junction formations and by linking cerebrovascular endothelial blood flux with neurons. Astrocytic activation responds to multiple pathologies involving BBB disruption, and upregulation of astrocytic cytoskeletal protein GFAP is the hallmark of such reactive astrogliosis.', 'Despite the great utility of positron emission tomography (PET) for measuring neuroinflammation in-vivo for clinical purposes, concerns about its invasive nature as well as high costs often preclude the use of PET in research settings. Non-invasive assessment of neuroinflammation thus remains difficult. Recent MRI-based methods, however, show promise for quantifying regional microglial activation – a part of the innate immune response. Specifically, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS) can be used to quantify the diffusivity of individual metabolites in the brain. The sequence detects microglial activation using apparent diffusion coefficient of cholinergic compounds (ADCCho), which reside in microglial cells in concentrations 3x higher than other brain cells. As microglia undergo morphological changes during activation, changing from a highly branched state to a more spherical one, cholinergic metabolites are able to diffuse more freely within these cells, resulting in higher ADCCho values detected in microglia-rich brain regions such as the thalamus. Importantly, injections of lipopolysaccharide – a potent inflammatory endotoxin – have been demonstrated to induce elevated ADCCho in the thalamus. DW-MRS may thus be an attractive tool for measuring neuroinflammation in the context of this PACS model along the gut-brain axis.', 'Gastrointestinal components of PACS', 'Dysbiosis', 'The gastrointestinal tract is the largest immune organ within the body, with microbiota regulating host immunity in conjunction with the intestinal mucosal layer. Although the main target of COVID-19 is the respiratory tract, several lines of evidence point toward substantial involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microbial dysbiosis – a decrease in the diversity of gut flora that allows pathogenic strains to become overrepresented – likely underpins the production of harmful byproducts in the intestine, which can subsequently accumulate within the gut lumen and proliferate systemically via a weakened intestinal barrier. Given that severe gastrointestinal disturbances are common in the acute stage of COVID-19, there is strong evidence for the resulting gut microbiota dysbiosis that can persist long-term. Crucially, symptoms such as diarrhea also commonly occur in patients who have mild cases of infection and do not require hospitalization. Indeed, microbiome examinations in PACS patients 6\\u2009months post-infection revealed decreases in diversity, suggesting that COVID-19-induced dysbiosis may persist chronically and maintain inflammation long-term.', 'Compelling evidence for the role of gut dysbiosis in PACS has been emerging via both observational and interventional studies, partially motivated by its relatively established contributions to chronic fatigue syndrome – a condition that shares several of its hallmark symptoms with PACS. Indeed, deficits of beneficial intestinal microbial strains and increased pathogen concentrations have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 patient groups, as well as across acute and chronic disease stages. Blooms of opportunistic and harmful bacteria, including those with antibiotic-resistance, have been reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, increasing their susceptibility to multi-drug resistant infections and mortality from septic shock to rates as high as 57%. In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with decreased microbial production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate – an important energy source for colonocyte metabolism and maintenance of colonic mucosal health. Deficits in butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been shown to reflect acute-stage COVID-19 severities and be associated with systemic proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. This microbiome under-representation of F. prausnitzii was found to persist chronically in PACS patients as well, with PACS symptom severities being inversely associated with gut levels of F. prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum – another butyrate-producing bacterial strain.', 'Detection of intestinal dysbiosis', 'While gut dysbiosis can be assessed using stool samples, this can present challenges in research settings. Lactulose breath testing offers non-invasive assessment of gut microbiota that does not require collection of stool samples, and uses hydrogen and methane concentrations in the breath to detect imbalances in gut microbial flora. Production of H2 via gut bacterial fermentation is abundant – about 13\\u2009L/day. While 60–70% is excreted, the rest is used by other gut bacteria, producing CH4 by reducing CO2, CH4O, and C2H3O2. In humans, H2 and CH4 are entirely microbially-derived, have no biological roles, and readily diffuse into blood via the intestinal wall, which allows them to be measured non-invasively in exhaled breath. Indeed, H2 and CH4 production in response to lactulose – an indigestible starch that gets fermented in the colon in a dose-dependent manner – can detect a form of dysbiosis called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). These two gasses are routinely measured in the clinical setting to estimate gut dysbiosis using a Lactulose Breath Test. A Lactulose Breath Test (LBT) positive for H2 (>20\\u2009ppm over baseline) indicates dysbiosis associated with diarrhea, while a positive CH4 result (>10\\u2009ppm over baseline) reflects methanogen overgrowth related to constipation. Lactulose breath testing may thus offer a useful measure of SIBO for identifying gut dysbiosis in PACS patients.', 'Gut microbiota and innate immunity', 'Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in fighting viral diseases, and while type I IFN is the dominant phenotype in systemic infections, type III IFN appears to preferentially enforce and strengthen the antiviral response at mucosal sites. Type III IFN receptors are extensively expressed at these sites, and organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs respond strongly to systemic expression of type III IFN. The microbiome appears to mediate type III IFN production and induce the expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes in the intestinal epithelium. Importantly, mucosal microbiomes can modulate IFN responses both locally and remotely, either by systemically releasing metabolites that prime distal immune and epithelial cells, or by being sampled by immune cells that migrate to other organs and influence local immune response. Microbial translocation itself can also drive the proliferation of altered immune IFN capabilities. For example, epithelial type III IFN promoters become suppressed and its receptors become cleaved in the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the mouth – a strain that is capable of translocation to mucosal surfaces in the gut and respiratory tissues, where it has been associated with dysbiosis and pneumonia, respectively. With growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 increases intestinal infections, type III IFN is thus emerging as a potential therapeutic target for both acute and chronic gastrointestinal sequelae of COVID-19. Importantly, type III IFN has been shown to be more potent and long-lasting than type I IFN in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in human intestinal epithelial cells.', 'Recently described timelines of the type I and type III IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection offer insight into the mechanisms of proinflammatory cytokine storms during acute COVID-19 as well as its long-lasting effects as part of PACS. As it evolved, the SARS-CoV-2 virus developed strategies to evade and antagonize pattern recognition receptor signaling, inhibiting IFNs and preventing activation of the host innate immune response. Of particular interest is that this dysregulated IFN response appears to occur in the upper airways and in the early stages of COVID-19, followed by exuberant IFN production in the context of a hyperactive inflammatory response that occurs later in the lungs. This reversal of the general immunity paradigm – that the IFN-mediated responses precede pro-inflammatory ones – has been shown to be specific to COVID-19, with influenza patients hospitalized for pneumonia showing traditional temporal IFN patterns. The delayed and exaggerated IFN activity in the acute stage of COVID-19 likely contributes its to long-term neurocognitive effects as well. Post-mortem COVID-19 analyses point to strong expression of type I IFN signatures that are specific to the choroid plexus, despite the absence of RNA and protein traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue. Such enhanced type I IFN signaling in the choroid plexus has been reported in both healthy aging under non-infectious conditions as well as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease – both of which are associated with decline in cognitive ability – and have been compared to PACS using other molecular signatures. The choroid plexus has thus been argued as particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, with the local type I IFN immune response being the possible driver of long-term cognitive deficits that are often reported in PACS. As such, this area may serve as a useful target for further inquiries into the neuropathology of PACS.', 'Intestinal barrier damage', 'In the context of the gut-brain PACS model, dysbiosis would presumably need to be coupled with increased gut permeability due to a compromised intestinal barrier, allowing for neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic substances such as LPS and PGN to permeate systemically. Consistent with the first prong of the proposed PACS pathogenesis along the gut-brain axis, SARS-CoV-2 has well-established effects on the intestinal epithelium that are analogous to those in the cerebrovascular endothelium. ACE2 receptors are extensively expressed by the intestinal enterocytes and serve as viral binding sites, promoting tissue-damaging interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the epithelium. The resulting compromises to the intestinal barrier facilitate systemic permeability of potentially harmful byproducts produced by the intestinal microbiome, which in turn can influence both local and systemic inflammatory activities, further compounding the runaway inflammation of COVID-19. Butyrate also plays an important role in preserving the intestinal barrier. In addition to supporting of the intestinal mucosal layer, butyrate helps maintain acetylation of histones, affecting the molecular remodeling of chromatin toward a transcriptionally ready state. In endothelial cells specifically, butyrate effectively suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and their LPS-induced release. As such, depletions of butyrate-producing bacteria have been suggested to exacerbate SARS-CoV-2-induced gut epithelial cell damage via insufficient downregulation of these mechanisms. Butyrate has also been shown to enrich the innate immune viral response via the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, upregulating interleukin-1β, interferon regulatory factor-7, and interferon-alpha/beta receptor at mRNA and protein levels. As such, butyrate appears likely to be involved in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2.', 'Markers of intestinal barrier damage', 'Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) is expressed by intestinal enterocytes, largely in the absorptive parts of the intestinal epithelial villi, where it is involved in fatty acid absorption and transport. While FABP2 is not a measure of transcellular permeability proper, such as Horseradish Peroxidase or Fluorescent Labeled Particles, it has emerged as a sensitive biomarker of intestinal epithelial dysfunction due to its physical cellular disentegration. For example, the intestinal epithelium is damaged during intestinal ischemia, and FABP2 is released into the blood, where it has been shown to reliably reflect such damage in humans. Indeed, intestinal and mesenteric ischemia has recently emerged as both a presenting feature and a late complication of COVID-19 during hospitalization, with approximately one-third of such patients having ultimately succumbed to the disease. While such severe cases warranted the computed tomography scans that ultimately revealed profound cases of gastrointestinal ischemia, increases in FABP2 have been detected in less severe COVID-19 cases as well. However, there remains the question of how prevalent intestinal microinfarctions are in mild disease severities, and whether they are associated with increased FABP2 plasma levels. As such, whether the epithelial damage is sustained via direct viral infiltration or indirectly by intestinal ischemia, FABP2 may a highly useful metric for quantifying intestinal permeability in PACS.', 'Zonulin, on the other hand, is specific to paracellular epithelial damage, and is often accompanied by transcellular permeability as well, as detected by aforementioned FABP2. Zonulin modulates the abilities of tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells to regulate paracellular permeability. Specifically, increased concentrations of zonulin disassemble ‘zonula occludens’ proteins, structurally disrupting the tight junction complex. Indeed, increased blood plasma concentrations of zonulin have been suggested to reflect intestinal permeability across several conditions, and are closely linked to plasma concentrations of endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide and transcellular permeability biomarker FABP2. Zonulin release has additionally been implicated in gut permeability associated with celiac disease and proposed to play roles in various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This leads us to speculate that similar chronic gastrointestinal disturbances in PACS patients may be due to elevated zonulin levels, with increased intestinal permeability allowing for dysbiosis-induced endotoxins to permeate systemically.', 'Systemic translocation of microbial products', 'Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut, and its presence induces systemic inflammation as well as microglial activation in the brain. The endotoxin has previously been found in elevated levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but its presence in the post-acute disease stage and contribution to the neurocognitive PACS symptoms remains unclear. Importantly, direct LPS infiltration of the brain has been demonstrated in rats, where it binds to endothelial cell receptors at blood–brain interfaces, thus further exacerbating the endothelial damage inflicted by the virus and cytokines described above. Of particular interest is that LPS has been shown to disrupt the blood–brain barrier in some brain regions, but not in others, impacting the BBB in the thalamus, frontal cortex, cerebellum, and pons-medulla. Thalamic and frontal impairments are of particular interest in the context of PACS, as these regions are important to higher-order cognitive processes. Systemic LPS may thus have a triple impact in post-COVID-19 pathology by stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage activation, directly interacting with the cerebrovascular endothelium concurrently with the virus, as well as increasing the exposure of some brain regions to neurotoxins via the compromised BBB.', 'Another common microbial byproduct that may contribute to systemic endotoxicity in PACS is peptidoglycan (PGN). While the term “endotoxin” has until recently been synonymous with LPS, PGN has emerged as a gram-positive counterpart of LPS in the recent years. This was largely driven by the increasing rates of sepsis due to gram-positive organisms, which have recently overcome those due to gram-negative bacteria. PGN concentrations in blood plasma have also been shown to reflect intestinal permeability due to ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, and ethanol-induced injury. Importantly, the presence of gut-derived PGN in brain dendritic cells and macrophages has been associated with idiopathic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis. Further, the neurotoxicity of PGN has been demonstrated in rats, where it induced acute microglial and astrocytic nitric oxide production, which mediate neuronal cell death. Beyond innate immunity, PGN has also been implicated in pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and its associated disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, which may be related to the potential cognitive sequelae of its neurotoxic properties. Like LPS, concentrations of PGN in blood plasma have also been shown to be elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As such, PGN concentration is a potential contributor to persistent neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in the PACS framework along the gut-brain axis.'], 'annotation': [{'16': {'identifier': None,
