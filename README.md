# ADBM: Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Research

## Overview

This project focuses on using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze research papers and identify relevant biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The system helps researchers filter and classify scientific literature to identify papers that contain information about protein biomarkers, specifically focusing on fluid biomarkers for AD detection and monitoring.
